<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p><span class="sc">Dear Boys:</span></p>
<p>One of the greatest, if not <i>the</i> greatest story of
all the ages, is the legend of Atlantis. According
to this legend, there existed at one time a great
continent in the Atlantic Ocean not far west of the
Pillars of Hercules, those two great rocks of
Gibraltar in Spain and Jibel Kebir in Morocco
which guard the entrance to the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>The legend says that this continent was the first
region in which man rose from barbarism to civilization,
and that in the course of ages it became
a populous and mighty nation from whose shores
immigrants went out to settle the shores of the
Gulf of Mexico, the valley of the Mississippi, the
valley of the Amazon, the Pacific coast of South
America, the shores of the Mediterranean, of the
Baltic, the Black Sea and the Caspian and the western
coast of Europe and Africa.</p>
<p>From this continent, continues the legend, the
first colonists penetrated western Africa clear to
Egypt where they took root in the Nile valley and
developed what is today conceded to be the earliest
known civilization.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_ii">ii</div>
<p>Many other startling statements are made in this
legend. For instance, it is said that the civilizations
of the Incas in Peru and the Mayas in Central
America, like the civilization of Egypt, were derived
from Atlantis through immigration; that the
Atlanteans were the first manufacturers of iron, and
that the implements of the &ldquo;Bronze Age&rdquo; in Europe
were derived from them; that the Phoenician alphabet,
parents of all European alphabets, was derived
from Atlantis, bearing a startling resemblance to
the alphabet of the vanished race of the Mayas in
Central America, whose ancient cities are just this
very day, as you can read in your papers, being unearthed;
that the gods and goddesses of the ancient
Greeks, the Phoenicians, the Hindus and the Scandinavians
were merely the kings and queens and
heroes of Atlantis, about whose real historic actions
the migrating Atlanteans remembered stories which
eventually went to create the mythology of their
descendants.</p>
<p>There is much else of this sort, all culminating
in the great outstanding feature of the legend which
is that Atlantis was destroyed in a terrible convulsion
of nature, and sank beneath the ocean with almost
all its inhabitants, leaving only a few of the
loftiest peaks sticking above the water, which today
comprise the islands of Madeira, the Azores and
the Bermudas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_iii">iii</div>
<p>From this cataclysm a few Atlanteans, it is related,
escaped to neighboring shores in rafts and
ships, bearing their tale of horror. And from these
tales arose the legend of a great Flood or Deluge,
which has survived to our own time in the Book of
Genesis in the Bible and in the mythologies of all
peoples of both the Old and the New Worlds.</p>
<p>This is the legend, then, and that for thousands
of years it was regarded as a fable proves nothing.</p>
<p>People used to believe the legends of the buried
cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum were myths.
They believed so for a thousand years, before archaeologists
exposed the ruins. The historian Herodotus
was called &ldquo;the father of liars&rdquo; for a thousand
years, because he wrote of the wonders of the ancient
civilizations of the Nile valley and of Chaldea.
But now it is known he spoke the truth.</p>
<p>It is so with this legend of Atlantis, of which the
great Greek, Plato, has left us the most detailed account.
All these thousands of years since Plato
wrote his account of Atlantis, 400 years before the
Birth of Christ, he has been regarded as a poetizer.
But in the light of recent researches, which really
are just beginning, it appears as if what he wrote
was not legend but history, and as if, indeed, his
story is one of the most valuable documents which
have come down to us from antiquity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_iv">iv</div>
<p>Some day you must hunt up and read for yourselves
a book entitled &ldquo;Atlantis or the Antediluvian
World.&rdquo; Written by Ignatius Donnelly, it was published
by Harper &amp; Brothers in 1882. In it are collected
Plato&rsquo;s story of Atlantis and a wealth of evidences
which go to prove, in the author&rsquo;s opinion,
that Atlantis did actually exist, that it was the home
of the white race, the Semitic race and, perhaps, the
Turanian, and that it was destroyed by a convulsion
of Nature.</p>
<p>Since Donnelly&rsquo;s book, investigation has gone
further. Savants uncovered near the southern edge
of the Sahara Desert about the time of the outbreak
of the Great War the ruins of two great cities of an
unknown civilization, believed to have been seats
of a migration from Atlantis. The war, however,
halted their research, and up to a recent period the
investigation had not been resumed. In one of these
cities, people of an unknown white strain resided in
a semi-savage state. I, therefore, have made them
the background for this story, and that you will like
it is the hope of</p>

<h1 title="">THE RADIO BOYS SEEK THE LOST ATLANTIS</h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I.
<br /><span class="small">INTRODUCTION.</span></h2>
<p>Jack Hampton wearily passed a hand across his
eyes. Would they never sight the oasis at which Ali
had promised they would arrive at the end of the
day&rsquo;s march? Even after many days of travel on
camel-back, Jack had not become sufficiently accustomed
to the soft-footed swaying brute to make
a long day&rsquo;s ride a pleasure.</p>
<p>And this was a long day&rsquo;s ride indeed. Except
for a brief halt at noon the caravan had been on the
march across the lifeless sand dunes of the desert,
unbroken by trees, rocks, animals or human beings,
unbroken by anything, in fact, except occasional
stunted bushes, since dawn. In another half hour
the sun would descend, and if the promised oasis
were not sighted by then, they would be forced to
spend another night on the desert.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>Looking back from his position at the head of the
column, Jack could see Bob Temple and Frank
Merrick, both mounted as was he, behind them a
half dozen shuffling camels with astride each among
the bundles a swarthy Arab enfolded in the inevitable
jillab, from the folds of which stuck out a
long-barrelled rifle, and bringing up the rear Jack&rsquo;s
father and Ali, his head man, both engaged in conversation.</p>
<p>The loop aerial rigged up on Frank&rsquo;s camel
caught Jack&rsquo;s gaze, and his eyes brightened. He
decided he would break the monotony of this desert
travel by kidding his friend. And with that purpose
in view, he halted his camel, to await Frank&rsquo;s
approach.</p>
<p>To himself Jack chuckled as he thought of the
bewilderment and wonder which Frank had aroused
amongst the camel drivers by his aerial. Attached
to a light frame strapped to the camel&rsquo;s hump,
ground wire trailing between the animal&rsquo;s feet,
Frank had rigged up the set the day before upon
Ali&rsquo;s declaration that another day would see them
at the Oasis Aiz-Or. He wanted to be in a position
to receive any message which Professor Souchard,
a Swiss savant, who awaited their coming, might
send out. For with him Professor Souchard had a
duplex radio apparatus for both sending and receiving,
which the boys jointly had devised.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>Many months before Professor Souchard had
entered the Sahara to prepare for their coming. Not
that it was his first visit to the Great Desert, however.
On the contrary, twenty years of his life had
been spent in poking about its endless reaches in
search of the ruins of an incredibly ancient city
which he had reason to believe had been founded in
prehistoric times by colonists from the lost continent
of Atlantis, that fabled land in the Atlantic ocean
which had been the seat of all civilization and had
been swallowed up in a tremendous cataclysm of
Nature giving rise to the universal legends of The
Flood.</p>
<p>Toward the end of his period of explorations,
Professor Souchard had come to an oasis lying far
from the few known routes, the Oasis of Aiz-Or,
inhabited by a small desert tribe. From it he had
glimpsed far to the southward the peaks of a mountain
range. When he asked the Arabs what
mountains lay there, they had replied it was the
Land of Shaitun, which in English means Satan.
The mountains were accursed said the Arabs, and
all who ventured near were never heard of again.</p>
<p>At least five days&rsquo; travel intervened, said Professor
Souchard&rsquo;s hosts, with no water holes in the direct
route, although three small springs bubbling from
beneath great rocks lay somewhere between the
oasis and the mountain wall. But without guides,
a traveller would be unable to find them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>Nothing daunted, Professor Souchard accompanied
by his faithful companion, Ben Hassim, had
set out. For the mountains of Shaitun, he believed,
were unknown to geographers. And the ancient
Egyptian inscriptions which spoke of the great city
of the past for which he had been searching through
the years referred to the mountains surrounding it.
Perhaps, therefore, the city he sought was within
that mountain wall.</p>
<p>The scientist and Ben Hassim finally did manage
to attain to the foot of the mountain wall, which
rose unbroken from the plain, on the fifth day. But
their supply of water was exhausted, they were
semi-delirious. For two days they travelled along
the base of the wall, seeking some pass or valley
which pierced the barrier.</p>
<p>At length on the seventh day they came upon a
stone-paved road and, scarcely able to believe the
evidence of their senses, they began to follow along
it into the mountains. Before proceeding far, however,
they were overcome by fever and thirst and
fell insensible. In this condition, they were found
and rescued.</p>
<p>Upon recovery they found themselves amidst
great stone ruins of ponderous architecture, in the
midst of a luxuriant valley watered by a broad
stream encircling one side, which emerged from a
tunnel in the mountains and disappeared again into
the mountains, not to reach the surface more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>Their rescuers were kindly men, several of whom
possessed a good command of English, and they
were white. But as Professor Souchard&rsquo;s knowledge
of English was strictly limited, they could not
understand each other well.</p>
<p>However, while being nursed back to strength,
the scientist managed to make out that his rescuers
were political refugees from another city in the
heart of the mountains known as Athensi, and that
in this city and the plateaus surrounding it dwelt a
white race of semi-civilized people ruled over by a
religious Oligarchy. His rescuers were men of
superior intelligence and a high state of culture and
that they had travelled about the world was apparent.
With his slight knowledge of English and
a smattering of their tongue which he picked up,
he was able to come to that conclusion.</p>
<p>To him it became apparent that the ruined city
of Korakum, overgrown by rank jungle growth and
in the midst of which the Athensian exiles cultivated
little patches of garden, was the city he had been
seeking. But the little he could learn of Athensi
fired his imagination. Apparently, at some dim age
in the past the settlers of this ruined city which had
been called Korakum had withdrawn into the mountain
country and built Athensi, where were palaces,
temples, a vast Coliseum, above all, a great Library
housing thousands of papyrus rolls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>If he could only gain access to Athensi, thought
Professor Souchard, what wonders and mysteries of
the ancient world, perhaps of a civilization existing
in Atlantis before the Flood, would be revealed.</p>
<p>However, on his recovery, the exiles told him it
was best for him to depart before the Athensian
authorities discovered his presence, as they wished
to preserve isolation from the outside world and did
not want their secret discovered. Therefore, after
supplying him with water and food, they started him
and Ben Hassim on the return journey.</p>
<p>Well did Jack recall the arrival of Professor
Souchard at his father&rsquo;s home on Long Island with
this tale. Mr. Hampton, himself an explorer and
engineer of wide reputation, had been enthusiastic.
He had promised the scientist, whose funds had
become exhausted and who was unable to obtain
backing for further explorations in war-exhausted
Europe, to finance an expedition to Athensi.</p>
<p>With this promise, Professor Souchard had
returned to Africa, and as soon as he could put his
affairs in shape for prolonged absence, Mr. Hampton
had followed. With him he had taken Jack and the
latter&rsquo;s close chums, Bob Temple and Frank
Merrick.</p>
<p>Those of our readers familiar with the three
Radio Boys by reason of following their adventures
chronicled in &ldquo;The Radio Boys on the Mexican
Border,&rdquo; &ldquo;With the Revenue Guards,&rdquo; &ldquo;On Secret
Service Duty,&rdquo; &ldquo;In Search of the Inca Treasure&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Rescuing the Lost Expedition,&rdquo; will realize that
three more reliable young fellows in just such a
situation could not be found.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>Jack and Bob were both six feet tall, and Bob in
addition was possessed of extraordinary strength.
As for Frank, an orphan, who made his home with
Bob on the Temple estate, adjoining that of the
Hamptons&rsquo; near Southampton, Long Island, what
he lacked in inches and girth, was made up in quickness
of intellect. All three were students at Yale.</p>
<p>This was the way matters stood, with the party at
length after its trip across the Sahara from Khartum
drawing near the Oasis Aiz-Or, when Jack paused
to await the approach of his comrades.</p>
<p>As Frank drew nearer, Jack smiled. He was
thinking of the other&rsquo;s comical appearance. Wrapped
in the voluminous jillab which all wore as it provided
greater protection against sand and heat than
European clothing, Frank was crowned by a sun
helmet, startling by contrast, and beneath it wore
headphones clamped over his ears.</p>
<p>Jack was on the point of calling out some laughing
remark about the latter&rsquo;s vain wait for a message
from Professor Souchard, when Frank&rsquo;s face suddenly
betrayed alarm. And with a shout he tore the
headset from his ears, sending the sun helmet
spinning out on the floor of the desert. Turning
about, he beckoned wildly for Mr. Hampton and
Ali to approach.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; shouted Jack. &ldquo;What did you
hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For, that Frank had received some message filling
him with alarm was apparent.</p>
<p>Frank did not reply. His face grew pale beneath
the heavy tan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II.
<br /><span class="small">A CRY FOR HELP.</span></h2>
<p>The long rays of the setting sun, which almost
touched the horizon, were flung across the desert,
turning it into dazzling gold, as Mr. Hampton and
Ali pushed their camels close to where the three boys
had come together. The camels stood with feet
spread apart, seemingly asleep. Jack and Bob, who
also had drawn close, were bombarding Frank with
questions and, almost inarticulate at first, he had
just begun to answer when Mr. Hampton and Ali
arrived.</p>
<p>In the background crowded the half dozen Arab
guards, sensing something amiss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cry for help,&rdquo; Mr. Hampton heard Frank say.
&ldquo;The Professor was sending out an appeal to us.&rdquo;
Frank looked wildly around at the group. &ldquo;Great
Scott, can&rsquo;t we do something?&rdquo; he appealed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Calm down, Frank,&rdquo; said Mr. Hampton. &ldquo;Tell
us about it, and then we can decide what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frank nodded as he got a grip on his emotions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe, I was a little inarticulate,&rdquo; he said,
with a rueful smile. &ldquo;But, just think. Here I was,
bumping along on my camel, and half asleep. I had
the headpiece on, the phones to my ears. But I
hadn&rsquo;t any real idea I&rsquo;d hear anything. What&rsquo;s
there to hear, way out here, away from all the
world? The only chance was that Professor
Souchard would take a notion to broadcast something
for our benefit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused and looked at the others, before swallowing
and resuming, with his face still pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suddenly I heard the Professor&rsquo;s voice, just as
if he were right out there on the desert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frank pointed off into the sunset, and involuntarily,
so strong was the impression created by his
words, the others stared, too. All, however, in a
moment restored their gaze to Frank&rsquo;s face&mdash;that
is, all except Ali. He continued to stare through the
sun wrinkles about his sharp, dark eyes. He even
raised a strong brown hand to shield his eyes from
the sun. The others, however, paid him no attention.
They had eyes only for Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; re-iterated Frank, &ldquo;it sounded as if the
Professor were right out there on the desert. His
voice was agonized, he was stammering as if in a
frenzy of terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If you hear me, my friends, come. This is
Souchard. I have run fast to get to this little instrument.
It is a raid. I think they are white. I
think they are Athensians, and&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>Dramatically, sensing the breathless interest of his
auditors, Frank paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;that was all. No, not
really all, for there was a sudden sharp crash that
almost broke my ear drums. Then silence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped. They continued to gaze at him.
Nobody spoke for a long minute. Every face was
pale. Every one of Frank&rsquo;s three white auditors
breathed faster. Even the Arab guards, bunched
in the background, unable to understand Frank&rsquo;s
rapid narrative in English, still understood something
was amiss. Only Ali paid no attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is terrible, Frank,&rdquo; said Mr. Hampton,
breaking the weighty silence. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure you
could not have been mistaken?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frank shrugged his shoulders under the flowing
burnoose such as they all wore, finding it more effectual
to keep out the heat and wind-whipped sand
than any European costume.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as I told you, Mr. Hampton,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The
Professor&rsquo;s voice might have been coming from no
farther than you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I thought so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The interruption came from Ali, whose command
of English was fluent. Ali was a cosmopolitan from
the teeming streets of Cairo, a man of many
languages.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Now he turned to Mr. Hampton, pointing off to
the west, straight into the eye of the sinking sun,
which now was half below the horizon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Faintly limned against the shining disk of the sun,
yet as clear as an etching, could be seen a tracery of
lines that might, by active stretch of the imagination,
be considered palm trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Oasis of Aiz-Or,&rdquo; said Ali.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What. That close,&rdquo; cried Mr. Hampton. &ldquo;Come,
perhaps, we can still be in time to help. That cannot
be far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five miles at least,&rdquo; said Ali. &ldquo;But we shall
hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning, he addressed the Arabs in their own
tongue. On each face came a gleam of determination.
These were men who could be depended upon,
men, moreover, not only ready but eager, in all likelihood,
for a fight.</p>
<p>Those whose only knowledge of camels has been
gleaned from circus or zoo cannot appreciate the
speed of which these desert travellers are capable
under urging. A clatter of grunts, punches and
camel cries succeeded Ali&rsquo;s command to his men, and
then the caravan was under way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Lurching this way and that, clinging for dear life,
the boys and Mr. Hampton managed not only to
retain their seats, but also to keep up with the others.
On galloped the camels, every moment exhorted to
further efforts. For a few minutes, while the sun
still held, the trees of the oasis outlined against it
seemed literally to hurl themselves forward, so rapid
was the pace of the approaching party. Then the
sun dropped out of sight, literally fell away, and was
succeeded at once by darkness.</p>
<p>Still the party kept on without abating its pace,
the long legs of the camels eating up the miles at
an unbelievably rapid rate. Jack, Bob and Frank
had no time for thought. They were wracked in
every limb. They felt as if they were being torn
apart on a torture machine. Still they clung, while
their camels surged forward with the rest.</p>
<p>Then Ali&rsquo;s voice was raised in a sharp command,
and at once the other Arabs repeated certain cries
to their camels which slowed them down. The boys
had the good sense to realize what was wanted, and
they, too, emitted the necessary grunts which seemed
to constitute the language of camels.</p>
<p>What was the explanation of this maneuvre?
Simply that Ali saw looming ahead the shadowy
outlines of the tall feathered palm trees constituting
the little oasis, and had no desire to charge blindly
without preparation or plan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>Mr. Hampton urged his camel alongside that of
Ali, and the boys also approached. Although twenty-five
years older than his son, Mr. Hampton had an
iron frame inured to fatigue through years of roughing
it in the out-of-the-way places of the world. He
was less blown as a result of the wild ride than the
young fellows.</p>
<p>Long since he had given up any idea of keeping
the boys out of danger. All were strong and cool-headed
in emergencies, and he had received plenty
of evidence during recent years that they could take
care of themselves.</p>
<p>Rapidly he outlined what was to be done. Let
all dismount, hobble the camels and leave them in
charge of two of Ali&rsquo;s men, and the balance of the
party, consisting of Ali, four Arabs, the three boys
and himself, nine in all, would advance afoot. In
this way, the noise of their approach could be
minimized. Besides, so far as four of their number
were concerned, they would be better able to render
a good account of themselves than if on camel back.</p>
<p>Ali acquiesced, the necessary commands were
given, and all caused their camels to kneel while
they dismounted. Then two of the number were left
adjusting hobbles and guarding the animals, while
the others spread out a yard apart, and began to
steal forward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III.
<br /><span class="small">THE MYSTERY AT THE OASIS.</span></h2>
<p>There is something wonderfully exhilarating in
night on the open desert. The boys felt it, so did
Mr. Hampton. Who knows? Perhaps Ali and the
Arabs were subject to this mysterious influence, too.
Shortly, a little after seven as they knew from experience,
the moon would be up, silvering the plain.
All now, however, was in darkness except for the
dim light of the stars. Yet it was a darkness filled
with caressing breezes and the feeling of beauty.</p>
<p>Despite the adventurous quest upon which they
were embarked, despite the possibility, nay, the
probability, that in a moment the night would be
shattered with strife and death, each found himself
yielding insensibly to this softening influence.</p>
<p>Suddenly the howling of a dog broke the stillness.
It was a long wailing cry that made the nerves
quiver and caused each member of the party to grow
tense. When does a dog howl like that? Ali and
the Arabs knew. The rest, with their sensitive intelligences,
guessed at the meaning. That howl
meant mourning over a fallen master.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>As if it were a signal, other dogs joined in. A
whole chorus of wailing notes effectively shattered
the stillness of night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton&rsquo;s whisper ran along the ragged line.</p>
<p>Again they advanced. Still not a sound from the
oasis except the howls of dogs.</p>
<p>The trees were closer now. Their leafy tops stood
out stark against the sky. Abruptly as the seashore
meets the land and ends, sand, the desert sand, met
the thick grass of the oasis and ended. They were
under the trees, in the grass, pushing forward.</p>
<p>Suddenly the moon rose, and a new weird light
fell over everything, bringing out the outlines of the
trees, shedding a silver radiance between their tall
trunks. Jack, who was in the middle of the advancing
line, paused, startled. Some huge objects,
black and indefinite in shape, seemed to rise out of
the ground in front of him.</p>
<p>What were they? He glanced hastily at the
shadowy forms of his companions, whom he could
discern among the trees right and left of him.
Evidently, they, too, had seen, for they also had
paused.</p>
<p>The line moved forward, Ali and the Arabs taking
the initiative. Jack advanced, too. If Ali felt
no alarm, certainly he was not going to exhibit any.
Bob and Frank experienced similar feelings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>Then, in a moment, the nature of those strange
objects became apparent. They were tents&mdash;great
rambling horsehair tents of the Bedouins or desert
Arabs.</p>
<p>The howling of the dogs continued, at no great
distance now, seeming to come from the other side
of the tents which were a half dozen in number.
Not a light was apparent. Not a human sound fell
on their ears. A low command from Ali to his
Arabs, from Mr. Hampton to the boys, drew in the
scattered members of the line to a central group.
They were at the rear of one of the Bedouin tents,
the largest of all, probably that of the tribal sheik.
So close were they that they could have put out their
hands and touched it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strangest thing I ever saw,&rdquo; muttered Mr.
Hampton. &ldquo;Not a soul around apparently. Out
with your flashlights now, fellows, and we&rsquo;ll make
a search. Keep your rifles ready to deal with
emergencies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Around to the front of the tent they stole. The
trees were thinned out. In the weird glow of the
moon which penetrated to this open space, everything
was plain to be seen. The five tents stood a
little apart from each other, clustered to one side.
On the other side could be seen a well, its water
gleaming in the moonlight.</p>
<p>Not a soul advanced to meet them. Not a light
showed in any tent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>The howling of the dogs continued, Ali with a
muttered word of command to his Arabs strode forward,
passing the well on his left. Two of his
followers went at his heels. In a moment he was
among the dogs, kicking them aside, as their sharper
yelping testified.</p>
<p>Before Mr. Hampton or any of those left behind
could begin an investigation of the tents, Ali came
flying back, leaving his two Arabs behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three men dead,&rdquo; he declared tersely. &ldquo;One
the Professor, another Ben Hassim, the third a
strange white man in strange clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a look,&rdquo; said Mr. Hampton. &ldquo;In the
meantime, do you investigate the tents to see if
there is anybody here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ali nodded and Mr. Hampton strode away, calling
the boys to follow. Jack turned as he passed
the well. Already Ali, flashlight in hand, was diving
into the biggest of the tents, with an Arab at his
heels, while another was stationed in the open space
on guard. The cautious Ali was taking no chance
of being surprised in the rear.</p>
<p>A little beyond the well, they came upon the two
Arabs left in charge of the dead by Ali, while the
dogs, reduced to low whines, crouched or circled
at a distance. The bodies of the fallen men had been
straightened. They lay on their backs, their faces
upturned to the moonlight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>Mr. Hampton knelt beside the body of the Professor,
placing one hand on his forehead and the
other on his wrist. He shook his head sorrowfully
and raised a heavy glance toward the boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>No sign of life could be discovered, either, in the
body of Ben Hassim.</p>
<p>Then that of the third man was approached. As
Ali had said, he was a white man, of medium height,
with a sharp, hawk-like cast of features. Even in
the weird moonlight, the strangeness of the white
toga-like garment, belted in at the waist with a dark
heavy cord, falling to a little below the knees and
leaving the legs bare, could be seen. Unlike the
others, whose eyes were opened in death, this man
lay with his eyes closed. Mr. Hampton bent forward
with a sharp exclamation.</p>
<p>After making a quick examination, during which
the boys whispered to each other in comment on the
man&rsquo;s unusual dress and appearance, Mr. Hampton
got quickly to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This man shows signs of life,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Two
of you carry him back to the tents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to the Arabs and directed them to
take up Ben Hassim&rsquo;s body. Then he and Jack
lifted that of the Professor. Bob and Frank, bearing
the body of the third man, led the way, and the
little procession moved back to the clearing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>They were met by Ali, who in the short time of
their absence had managed to search all the tents,
and had succeeded in finding neither living nor dead
except for one old woman who could hardly be said
to be either. Although alive, she was half dead
from fright.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV.
<br /><span class="small">THE MYSTERY DEEPENS.</span></h2>
<p>The old woman was given in charge of the Arabs
to be questioned later. She was so old that she went
without a veil when in the presence of men. Reduced
to a state of abject fear by events yet to be learned,
she was left in charge of two Arabs placed on guard
by a fire lighted in the middle of the open enclosure.</p>
<p>The first thing to be done was to look after the
wounded man. Mr. Hampton ordered him carried
into the large tent, which had been that of the Sheik
Abraham, leader of this little tribe of Arabs which
inhabited the Oasis Aiz-Or. Grass mats were scattered
about the roomy interior, and there was a
divan covered with faded rugs. On a little tabouret
burned a lamp of palmolive oil which gave off a not
unpleasant odor.</p>
<p>The boys who followed close at the heels of the
Arab bearers looked around with curiosity, while the
body of the wounded man was laid on the divan and
Mr. Hampton began making a critical examination
to determine the extent of his injuries.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>Casting their flashlights into the shadows not
penetrated by the feeble rays of the lamp which Ali
had found and lighted, the boys discerned a heavy
curtain cutting off one part of the tent. Ali came
up to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the women&rsquo;s quarters,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Sheik
Abraham kept his three wives there. I have never
been here before. The oasis is far from all travel
routes and Sheik Abraham rarely, if ever, got to the
bigger desert towns and villages. But I believe he
must have had three wives, for there are that many
divans. Ordinarily it would be death for an unbeliever
to penetrate into the women&rsquo;s quarters. Sheik
Abraham is a Mohammedan, of course.&rdquo; He
shrugged. Ali was a cosmopolite and to the boys
spoke cynically of all religion. Yet they had seen
him spread his prayer mat and perform his devotions
night and morning with the other Arabs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Ali, lifting the curtain, &ldquo;you can see
an Arab sheik&rsquo;s selemlik without fear. Behold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After all, the boys were disappointed. Desultory
reading about Arab sheiks had led them to expect
they knew not what. Certainly, handsome tents,
softly carpeted, filled with silks and perfumes, with
shining lances and silver-mounted rifles. As for the
selemlik, or women&rsquo;s quarters, they believed such a
place would be a nest of beauty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>Instead, there were three or four divans covered
with rugs of faded patterns and colors, a cheap
cracked mirror hanging askew on one wall of the
tent, a veil thrown awry over one divan, and that
was all.</p>
<p>Ali explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The women left in haste,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Perhaps,
they were carried off by the attackers. Yet they
had time to bundle their clothes and take them
along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Questions burned on the boys&rsquo; lips, and they flung
them at Ali. Who had attacked? Had the whole
tribe been carried off into captivity? Why had the
Professor and his faithful servant, Ben Hassim,
alone been killed?</p>
<p>Ali shook his head. They must wait until the old
woman was in a state to be questioned. Perhaps,
too, some information could be wrung from the lips
of the wounded captive, although it was possible
from his appearance that he did not speak Arabic.
Never had Ali seen a man dressed as he, and a white
man, too. It was all a nightmare, non-understandable.
Let the boys wait until Allah sent an interpretation.</p>
<p>With this they had to be content. Dropping the
curtain, they emerged into the main portion of the
tent, finding Mr. Hampton absorbed in his attempt
to revive the wounded prisoner. He looked up only
long enough to explain he had been unable to find
any wound from bullet, sword or spear. The man
had been felled by a blow on the head. Mr. Hampton
was not certain whether concussion of the brain had
followed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>One of the Arabs he had despatched to bring up
the two guards and the camels, left in the desert.
When the caravan arrived, he would be able to get
his medical and surgical supplies. Then he would
see what further could be done. Possessed of a
knowledge of rude surgery acquired in his out-of-the-way
expeditions, Mr. Hampton was able to set
broken limbs and perform minor operations, but
trepanning was beyond him. Should that prove
necessary, he would be helpless to aid the fallen
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have a look at the Professor&rsquo;s
tent, Dad,&rdquo; explained Jack, following his father&rsquo;s
remarks. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be back soon. Want to see what
happened to his radio outfit, for one thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton nodded, and the boys trooped out
at Ali&rsquo;s heels. Three Arabs hunkered over the fire,
for the night had turned chill, as it invariably does
on the great desert. Beside them was the figure of
the old woman. They were not speaking, but sat
motionless, staring into the flames. The fourth man
had gone for his two comrades left in charge of the
camels.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>Ali led the way into another tent. While the boys
played their flashlights about the interior, he found
and lighted an oil lamp, a shallow copper vessel
with a spout that held a wick. When this was
lighted, they examined the place more closely.</p>
<p>Smaller than Sheik Abraham&rsquo;s tent, there was no
dividing curtain, as here was no need for a selemlik.
On two divans had slept the Professor and Ben
Hassim. Everything was in wildest confusion.
Three long narrow trunks were broken open and
their contents of clothing, books, maps and scientific
instruments were scattered about. These things the
boys put aside for later inspection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where was his radio?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>A cry from Bob answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, fellows,&rdquo; called the big husky.
&ldquo;Smashed as if with an ax. A perfect ruin if ever
I saw one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They hastened to his side. The broadcasting set
which the boys had made themselves and which had
been their gift to Professor Souchard, had been
made to fit into one&mdash;the smallest&mdash;of the three
shallow trunks. It had included a folding table on
which it was to be mounted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>The table had been set up in one corner of the
tent. Instead of dry cells, the current was supplied
by a motor. Everything had been properly set up
in the method into which the boys had drilled the
Professor. The key had been screwed to the middle
of the table and near the front edge. Back of it had
been placed the high tension condenser, with the
oscillation transformer still farther in the rear. To
the left of the oscillation transformer had been
placed the alternating current transformer and in
front of it was the quenched gap.</p>
<p>Even though the table and its contents had been
smashed, as if with an ax, this much could be seen.
Doubtless, too, the wiring had been done according
to directions. Otherwise, the Professor would not
have been able, of course, to communicate with
Frank. But the wrecking of the station had been
so thoroughly carried out that it was impossible to
tell.</p>
<p>Where the wires from the motor had been connected
with a single-throw, double-pole switch,
which in turn was connected with the primary coil
of the alternating power transformer and with one
post of the key, the other post of which was connected
with the switch, there was now only a mass
of tangled and chopped wires. As for the connections
between the motor of the rotary spark gap
to the power circuit, and between the secondary
coil, the quenched spark gap, the condenser and the
primary coil of the oscillation transformer, thus
completing the closed oscillation circuit, they too,
were a tangled mess.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>The telephone instrument wired as an alternative
to the key, thus permitting the sending either of
telegraph or conversation, had been ripped away
and ground into the hard-packed earth of the floor.
At first it could not be found, but Frank stubbed
a foot against it finally.</p>
<p>The three boys looked at each other, while Ali
stood to one side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can make anything out of that, you fellows,&rdquo;
said Bob, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be going some. That&rsquo;s all
I can say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack shook his head dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come,&rdquo; expostulated Frank, who never
liked to take a dare, and this looked like a dare to
him, &ldquo;give me time and I&rsquo;ll have that fixed up.
We&rsquo;ve got all sorts of radio supplies in our luggage,
you know, and as long as the motor hasn&rsquo;t been
wrecked we can fix this up. I&rsquo;ll bet on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The motor had not been subject to the general
attack, as a matter of fact. Standing below the
table, perhaps it had been overlooked. At Frank&rsquo;s
words, therefore, the others nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, old thing,&rdquo; said Jack, slapping him
on the back. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll pitch in on this tomorrow, and
we&rsquo;ll have it fixed up in no time. That is,&rdquo; he
added, pausing, &ldquo;if something else doesn&rsquo;t come up
for us to do, like&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like what?&rdquo; demanded Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, either defending ourselves or pursuing the
raiders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pursuing them?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>
<p>Jack nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>&ldquo;When that old woman is able to talk, we&rsquo;ll find
out what happened here tonight,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If
Sheik Abraham and his few tribesmen and women
were carried off captive, and there is a chance we
can help them, I know father will want to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll want to do it, too,&rdquo; said big Bob,
gruffly. &ldquo;Darned shame these people getting into
trouble, and perhaps on our account, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our account?&rdquo; It was Jack&rsquo;s turn to look surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; said Bob, slangily. &ldquo;Why not?
How else can you figure it? Who was killed? Nobody
but the Professor and Ben Hassim, the two
men who had penetrated the Shaitun Mountains and
found this old city and learned about a way to get
to Athensi. Who killed &rsquo;em? Well, by the looks of
that wounded fellow your father is doctoring, it was
a raiding party of Athensians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody looked thoughtful. As for Jack, he
felt increased respect for his big friend&rsquo;s powers of
reasoning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, great Scott, Bob, what would bring them
six or seven days across the desert?&rdquo; he demanded.
&ldquo;As far as the Professor ever could discover, they
never left their hidden strongholds. Oh, of course,
once a year a party went to Gao. But I understood
that lay in an opposite direction from this oasis
across the desert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ali, who had been an interested listener to this
discussion, interrupted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, these strange people learned the Professor
meant to disturb their privacy and bring the
world to their doors,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And they resented,
and took this method of putting a stop to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how could they have learned about him or
his plans?&rdquo; demurred Frank. &ldquo;Oh, this is a mess.
Well, when that wounded chap finds his tongue,
maybe we&rsquo;ll learn something. Or when the old
woman becomes able to answer questions. Anyway,
let&rsquo;s look around here for any letters or papers or
other things the Professor might have left, and then
go back to your father, Jack.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V.
<br /><span class="small">ALLOLA&rsquo;S STORY.</span></h2>
<p>Several days passed, however, during which the
wounded Athensian, for such they all considered
him to be, lay in a stupor resembling death. Little
enough had the party to go on toward solving the
mystery of the raid on the Oasis Aiz-Or.</p>
<p>The old woman whose name was Allola, and who
proved to be the Sheik Abraham&rsquo;s mother, recovered
the use of her wits and her tongue, but what
information she was able to supply was only scanty.</p>
<p>She knew the Professor and Ben Hassim, not
alone from their most recent stay with her tribe, but
from their former visit. &ldquo;The Crazy One,&rdquo; she
described the Professor, bowing her head and hushing
her voice in reverence as she did so, for among
all primitive peoples those afflicted with insanity are
regarded as under the special protection of Providence.
And, although the Professor in reality was
far from insane, yet these desert Bedouins so considered
him because of his eccentricities and his
search for a lost city and his invasion of the dread
Shaitun Mountains.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>When the Professor with Ben Hassim had arrived
a second time at their isolated and almost
forgotten oasis, Allola said the Sheik Abraham, her
son, together with the dozen men of the tribe and
twice as many boys greeted him with joy, while she
and the women with their faces veiled watched
curiously from the tents.</p>
<p>A welcome visitor was the Professor to this
little tribe living apart from the world which rarely
saw or entertained anybody from the outside. For
the men he brought cigarettes, for the women many
cakes of sweet chocolate. They were very grateful,
and a tent had been set aside for him, and women
assigned to look after his needs.</p>
<p>Days had slipped into weeks and weeks into
months, while the Professor and Ben Hassim stayed
on. Frequently they would depart on long expeditions,
leading two fine camels which they had
brought with them, carrying food and water, and
bestriding their own fine animals. Allola&rsquo;s sharp
eyes regarded Mr. Hampton. She did not know
why they made these expeditions. Perhaps, he&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton smiled a little at her curiosity.
Then he turned to Ali and the boys who were
attentive listeners like himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Professor and Ben Hassim were scouting
around the base of the Shaitun Mountains,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;When he left me to come on in advance, Souchard
said he intended to put in his time prospecting the
mountain wall in both directions from the old stone
road up which he had stumbled into Korakum in
the first place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will remember that the men of Korakum
told him the only way to gain entrance to Athensi
was along the course of the subterranean river
passing around the walls of Korakum. This river
had its rise in the heart of the mountains behind
Athensi, passed through the valley in which that
city was situated, then disappeared again into the
mountains and after passing through a series of
natural caves or tunnels interspersed by open
stretches of canyon, emerged into the plains of
Korakum. Then it dived into the outer ring of
mountains, never to reappear above ground.
Probably, eventually, it reaches the Niger far to the
west of us.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it was my friend&rsquo;s belief, based on hints
dropped by one member of the exiled Athensians
living in Korakum, that the heights above the
hidden city could be gained by another method.
Very long ago, he gathered, there had been another
great road leading out from these heights to the
desert, but the Athensians had destroyed it in order
to preserve their isolation. It had been a great engineering
feat to build it, but they had ruthlessly
destroyed bridges across chasms and stone viaducts
along the faces of steep cliffs, thus ensuring the
impregnability of their city. However, Souchard
understood, although his informant never would
make a positive statement, that some of the exiles
had been busy patching up the gaps in this road,
flinging rude rope bridges across the chasms, and
so on, to the end that men might pass single file.
Doubtless, this was for purposes of accomplishing
a coup of their own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he was seeking that old road?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Hampton. &ldquo;And my guess is
that, perhaps, he was discovered at it, and was
tracked here and disposed of, in order that the secret
might not escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; cried big Bob, letting a long breath
escape. &ldquo;Pretty mess we&rsquo;re planning to go into. I
thought this was going to be a gentlemanly expedition,
with overtures made to the Athensian rulers
to let us come in and study their habits and history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here we are stepping into a hornet&rsquo;s nest,&rdquo;
supplemented Frank.</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton smiled slightly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;Professor Souchard gave me to believe that it
would be possible to approach the Athensians
peaceably,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Otherwise I would not have
undertaken this expedition, and brought you boys
into danger, of course. But I&rsquo;m beginning to believe
now that he exaggerated the ease of approach,
and minimized if he did not entirely ignore the
dangers. Remember, he knew nothing much of
the real Athensians. The exiles living in Korakum
were his sole source of information. And, although
he learned their language enough to converse with
them haltingly, so short was his stay that there
were many vital facts which he was unable to learn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I pointed this out to him,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;but he
said that when we arrived, we would stay at Korakum
examining the ruins, which in themselves are
worth any scientists&rsquo; time and study, and in the
meantime learn the Athensian language from the
exiles and gain a good working knowledge of the
manners and customs of the people of the hidden
city and the interior plateaus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, as you know, was to be our first step.
Afterwards, we were to proceed as our increased
knowledge dictated. If it seemed the proper thing
to do, we planned to send an embassy to the Athensians,
asking permission to visit their city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could it have been the exiles of Korakum, Dad,
who were responsible for this raid?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not believe so,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Souchard
described them as friendly to him, and as you know
they aided him to return to civilization. But enough
of that,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Let us hear the rest of Allola&rsquo;s
story.&rdquo; And turning to Ali, who acted as interpreter,
he asked him to bid the old woman continue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>Nothing loth, for she relished being the center of
attention and had resented this conversation in a
tongue she could not understand, Allola described
events on the day of the raid. &ldquo;The Crazy One&rdquo;
and Ben Hassim had been absent more than two
weeks from the oasis, but as they had stayed away
equally long if not longer in the past, nobody
worried. On leaving they had taken food and water
on their led camels sufficient for a protracted stay,
and it would not be necessary to feel anxiety about
them for at least another week.</p>
<p>In the morning, however, on looking at a calendar
which &ldquo;The Crazy One&rdquo; had given him and which
was a source of much satisfaction, as he had never
before been able to keep track of the passage of
days, Sheik Abraham had noticed a black mark
drawn around the date. Then he had recalled that
long before his friend had told him that on this day,
the thirtieth of the month, friends would arrive from
the east.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Mr. Hampton, while the boys
nodded. &ldquo;We had arranged with Professor Souchard
to time ourselves so as to arrive on this day. Leaving
Khartum on such and such a day, if all went
well, we would spend so many days in desert travel
and reach the oasis on the thirtieth.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>Allola proceeded. Noting the date and recalling
&ldquo;The Crazy One&rsquo;s&rdquo; words, the Sheik Abraham had
told the tribesmen to keep a sharp look out across
the southern desert, for the return of him and Ben
Hassim. All day the men and women, working
about the oasis, in their little farm patches or grinding
oil, had paused now and again to glance to the
south.</p>
<p>Not until late in the afternoon, however, had they
descried the looked-for figures approaching. They
had gone out a little way into the desert to welcome
them, and it had been a triumphal procession homeward.
Everybody had crowded around to hear the
tale of &ldquo;The Crazy One&rsquo;s&rdquo; latest wanderings, as
explained by the merry Ben Hassim, and it had not
been dreamed necessary to keep watch. No watch
ever was kept, anyway, as the tribe had no enemies
and few, indeed, were the travellers who came this
way.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a body of white men, strangely-clad
(like that other, said Allola, nodding toward the
tent within which lay the wounded Athensian) and
mounted on swift camels, dashed into the midst of
the encampment. They bore short heavy swords
and lances, but made no effort to harm anyone.</p>
<p>In number they were, perhaps, two score. Dividing,
they encircled the enclosure where the whole
tribe was gathered. The dozen men and the score
of half grown boys of the tribe, caught without
arms, were helpless to resist. All were made
prisoner, the Sheik Abraham was dragged from his
tent where he was conversing with &ldquo;The Crazy
One.&rdquo; The women were brought forth. Only
&ldquo;The Crazy One,&rdquo; rolling quickly beneath the wall
of the Sheik Abraham&rsquo;s tent, managed for the
moment to escape. Allola saw him from her retreat
beneath the Sheik Abraham&rsquo;s divan, where she had
thrown herself. She was overlooked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then I heard his voice screaming into the devil
machine,&rdquo; said Allola. &ldquo;And I knew he had fled
to his tent and was calling upon his gods for protection.
The strangers heard, too, and pursued and
caught him. There was a fight. I heard, but I
could not see. I lay hidden then until you came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton looked thoughtful. &ldquo;That explains
some things,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Professor Souchard hurrying
to get back to meet us was tracked by Athensians.
Probably he had aroused some watcher&rsquo;s
suspicions on an earlier scouting expedition along
their mountain wall, and when he appeared this time
a war party was summoned. Before it could arrive,
unconscious of his impending fate, he had departed.
But his trail across the desert was followed, the war
party pushed its animals and, although he may have
had a whole day&rsquo;s start, they caught up with him
an hour after his arrival at the oasis. He was cut
down as he called for help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack groaned. &ldquo;Poor old Professor. If only we
had been here. Our party, with guns, could have
put the Athensians to flight in a twinkling.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, boys, that&rsquo;s all for the time being,&rdquo; said
Mr. Hampton, at length, after some further discussion.
&ldquo;When we buried Professor Souchard
and Ben Hassim, as you will recall, there was no
mark of bullet. They had been garroted, their
necks broken, in the fashion of the Hindu Thugs.
Now Allola says she saw no guns among the Athensians.
These two circumstances would seem to
indicate they are without firearms. Nevertheless,
I cannot believe that a people, keeping up an annual
contact with the outside world, would be without
knowledge of firearms. Besides, those of the tribesmen
were taken, for there isn&rsquo;t one in the oasis.
Would they have taken guns without knowing their
use? No, they might have suspected they were
weapons and have smashed them, but they wouldn&rsquo;t
have carried them away. Then, too, there is this
matter of carrying off the whole tribe of Sheik
Abraham. What was the reason for that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably the raiders planned to use them as
slaves,&rdquo; said Ali, to whom the dark secrets of the
slave-raiders who still practice their trade in many
places in the heart of the Dark Continent from the
Abyssinian borders on the east to the Niger and
Kongo territory, were not unknown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Mr. Hampton, slowly. &ldquo;If the
tribesmen were to be used as slaves, that would indicate
why their lives were spared. But it is also
possibly the Athensians suspected Professor
Souchard might have imparted information regarding
their country, and they were taking no chances
on leaving any witness against them behind.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI.
<br /><span class="small">THE TALE OF THE SLAVE TRADER.</span></h2>
<p>Days succeeded during which the party marked
time. Mr. Hampton was resolved to take no further
steps until first having a talk with the wounded
Athensian. He was showing signs of recovery, and
was being fed broth at intervals, but was delirious.
Should he return to his senses, Mr. Hampton
planned to question him in his own tongue. From
Professor Souchard he had acquired an elementary
vocabulary in that language as taught the latter by
the Athensian exiles in Korakum.</p>
<p>In the meantime, after exhausting the possibilities
of the oasis and its small vegetable farms and flocks
of sheep and goats, which had been left behind by
the raiders, the boys found time hanging pretty
heavy on their hands.</p>
<p>Frank had more to occupy him than his comrades,
as he was intent on making good on his boast that
the radio station could be repaired. Almost every
waking hour he spent in this occupation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>Ali&rsquo;s stories of African life helped somewhat to
while away the time for all. This swarthy-cheeked,
hawk-nosed Arab had poked his nose into every
corner of northern Africa. And, when one considers
that the Sahara Desert alone is more than
3,250,000 square miles in extent, or the size of all
of the continent of Europe, that meant Ali had done
a lot of poking. He was intimately acquainted with
the life of every Mediterranean city from Tangiers
and Morocco to Port Said. He had crossed the
desert by every camel route. He knew the great
mountain of Asben in the middle of the Sahara.
He had travelled to Timbuktu. He had penetrated
to Lake Schad and the sources of the Nile, and had
voyaged on the Niger. In a word, Ali was a mine
of information on northern Africa.</p>
<p>Putting two and two together, he was able even
to say he had heard of the Athensians before the
Professor brought their existence to his attention.
Not that he heard of them by that name, however.
He told about it at the camp fire one night, while
Jack threw on the blaze several handsful of dried
coarse grass and the light leaped high, bringing out
the curious faces of the boys and Mr. Hampton and
the impassive features of the Arabs.</p>
<p>It was from another Arab, a slave trader who had
been to Gao, that Ali had the tale. This man Ali
encountered at a desert oasis one night. It had been
years before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;We were the first travellers who had visited that
oasis in a long time,&rdquo; said Ali. &ldquo;Some of these
isolated oasis are the homes of robbers who raid
caravans. But like Sheik Abraham, this sheik was
a harmless and pleasant old fellow. He made us
feel welcome. We sat on little grass mats on each
side of him in front of his tent. Before us was a
blazing fire on which his favorite wife now and then,
would throw a stick of wood or some grass. She
was young, veiled, and her hands were elaborately
tattooed. Silver bracelets and ankle-rings jingled
at every step. Yes, evidently she was the old
patriarch&rsquo;s favorite wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was very pleasant sitting there, and the woman
brought us bowls of <i>kous-kous-soo</i> and tiny brass
cups of sweet Moorish coffee on a tray. After eating,
we lighted cigarettes and began to talk. We
felt it was our duty to tell strange stories of our
adventures in order to repay our host&rsquo;s courtesies.
He was a man who did not travel, and it was our
duty to entertain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All paused a long time, staring impassively into
the fire. At length he resumed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the talk passed from this to that, and
presently this slave trader began to tell of a strange
people from whom every year came to the slave
marts of Gao a delegation seeking strong men.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;With them,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;comes a man who can
speak to Frenchman, Arab, Berber, Tuareg, all the
peoples of the desert, in his own tongue, a man who
speaks many Negro dialects, too. He is the leader.
There are two minor chieftains and a guard of two
score men armed with short swords, lances and
Arab rifles. The rifles have very long barrels and
much silver work on the stocks. They are worth a
great deal of money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;On the outskirts of Gao this party encamps,
while a picked force of ten warriors accompanies
the three leaders into the slave bazaars. As you
know, we dealers traffic in all sorts of human cattle.
We have Negroes from many different tribes, captured
in battle and sold us by the victors. Arabs,
Tuaregs, Berbers, also come to us from those who
have captured them in the fight. Even white men,
Frenchmen and Spaniards, captured in Morocco and
Algiers and Tripoli by fierce tribesmen, like the Riff
tribes who are forever fighting the Spaniards in the
Atlas mountains, reach us for sale into slavery&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come, now, Ali,&rdquo; interrupted Mr. Hampton,
good-naturedly, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a bit too thick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ali shrugged. &ldquo;Many things go on in Africa
which the whites cannot stop,&rdquo; he said, simply. &ldquo;It
is true, this I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But white men,&rdquo; protested Mr. Hampton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What think you, then, becomes of the men taken
prisoner from the French and Spanish and Italian
foreign legions when detachments are trapped in the
desert?&rdquo; asked Ali. &ldquo;They are not butchered. No,
they are too valuable. Some desert sheik or the
kaid of some desert city buys them for slaves.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Mr. Hampton. &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was quite convinced, yet he knew enough of
the mystery of this vast land to many parts of which
white men never even had penetrated to this day, to
realize what Ali described was not impossible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said this slave trader,&rdquo; continued Ali,
&ldquo;&lsquo;these strangers select the very strongest and
youngest of the men, be they white, black or brown.
Unless a man is of exceptional strength he is not
chosen. Sometimes they select only two or three,
sometimes a dozen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Only once have I been at Gao when these
strangers appeared. Much had I heard about them.
My curiosity was excited. That time I had among
my slaves a very strong man, a man of the Kongs.
He was a full six feet tall, beautifully proportioned,
with a fine intelligent head and a brown body like
mahogany. He was only twenty-one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The leader of the strangers came to me and
pointed out this man. He spoke in Arabic. He
wanted to know the Kong&rsquo;s antecedents, and I said
he had been taken in battle only after he had slain
five Bakus, being finally entrapped in a net thrown
over his head and arms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He took the Kong without even asking my
price, which was high. As he turned to go, I said
on the impulse, &ldquo;Whence come you?&rdquo; He stared at
me haughtily. For a moment I thought either he
would not answer or else would order his guards to
cut me down. Then he laughed, a wild, reckless
laugh. My blood chilled. &ldquo;I come from the country
of the past and of the future,&rdquo; said he. Then he was
gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I made inquiries. But from none could I learn
more than I have told. Slave traders come and go.
Within the memory of the oldest of us, reaching
back fifteen or twenty years, this stranger had come
once each year to the slave marts. For how long
before that he had come, I do not know. None ever
had pursued him into the east, to see whence he
came. That is all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; concluded Ali, &ldquo;I have since been thinking.
That man was a big chief among the Athensians,
if not the greatest leader himself. Who he is, how
he has acquired a knowledge of many languages, I
do not know. That he and his people are white, of
course, is not so marvellous, as the Berbers and
Arabs are white races, and so are the Kabyles who
inhabit the mountains of Morocco.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton nodded. &ldquo;An offshoot of the white
race which has maintained a splendid isolation in
those mountains south of us, undoubtedly. Yet
how this leader acquired his knowledge of civilization
puzzles me. And why, Ali, are these annual
expeditions to Gao made? And only the strongest
slaves selected?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>Ali shrugged. &ldquo;It is for Allah to say,&rdquo; he replied,
and lapsed into silence. Evidently, for that night,
the loquacious Ali had said all he intended to say.</p>
<p>His story, however, furnished Mr. Hampton with
food for reflection and on several occasions he discussed
the matter with the boys. Especially, did he
note that the slave trader&rsquo;s account, as repeated by
Ali, betrayed that the Athensians possessed rifles.
This made them more dangerous enemies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fact, boys,&rdquo; he concluded, one day, after a
lengthy discussion, &ldquo;I have become pretty firmly
convinced that these Athensians cannot be peacefully
approached as had been our original intention.
Therefore, we shall have to abandon the expedition.
I shall wait a few days more to see whether this man
recovers sufficiently to be moved, and then, if we
can gain nothing from him in response to questioning,
we shall set out to return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo; cried Jack in dismay, &ldquo;leave without
attempting to learn what we came all this way to
discover?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His father nodded gravely. &ldquo;Professor Souchard
and Ben Hassim have been slain,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Sheik
Abraham and all his tribe have been carried into
slavery. Quite evidently, the Athensians want no
intruders and we would only imperil our lives by
pursuing our investigations further.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;ll you do, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;I shall lay the matter before the French and
British governments. Now that the Great War is
over, it may receive attention. They can send embassies,
supported with sufficient power to compel
recognition. Then, it is possible, the Athensians
will yield on being shown no menace to their freedom
threatens, and may admit scientists to their
mountains to study the ruins of Korakum and the
library of Athensi, if such really exists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad,&rdquo; asked Jack, after a pause, &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;ve
spoken of this before, but I can&rsquo;t get it out of my
mind. Isn&rsquo;t it possible the Professor may have been
deluded, that all he told you was a creation of
fancy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, there was this raid on the oasis, the description
of the raiders, this wounded captive, and Ali&rsquo;s
story of the annual visit of the Athensians to the
slave marts of Gao.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Granted all that,&rdquo; Jack stubbornly objected, &ldquo;yet
it does seem nothing short of miraculous that a city
such as Athensi should exist unknown to the rest of
the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but, Jack,&rdquo; interrupted Bob, while Mr.
Hampton approvingly nodded, &ldquo;look at Llassa, the
Secret City of Thibet. Only one white man has
ever penetrated it and lived to tell the tale. And
that is in the heart of Asia, the oldest continent
known to civilization, while here is Athensi in the
heart of a continent which is still in many parts unexplored.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>Jack threw up his hands in token of surrender.
&ldquo;All right, old thing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just as keen
as you to carry this through, and I was just arguing.
I do wish father would continue with it, but I suppose
his plan is the best.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII.
<br /><span class="small">CHASING OSTRICHES.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Ali, come here. Take a look through these
glasses and tell me what you see,&rdquo; called big Bob
early one morning.</p>
<p>As he spoke he was approaching the encampment,
where the Arabs were preparing breakfast, at a run.</p>
<p>Ali looked up inquiringly, and Bob grasped him
by an arm and urged him forward, past the well,
through the patches of garden stuff, down among
a grove of fig trees, to the edge of the oasis. They
were facing eastward, and the sun which had not
been up long cast a dazzling radiance over the sand
dunes. These latter lay scattered indiscriminately,
like the waves in a choppy sea&mdash;great bare swellings
of sand, with here and there low stunted clumps of
bush.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>At first, gazing into the path of the sun, Ali could
descry nothing, but under Bob&rsquo;s direction he finally
located what had attracted the other&rsquo;s attention. This
was a number of dark black objects seeming like
bushes in motion. But Ali&rsquo;s better-trained desert
eye solved what had merely been a puzzle to Bob,
and without taking the glasses from his eyes he
exclaimed</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ostriches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ostriches?&rdquo; Big Bob could hardly believe he had
heard aright. &ldquo;Why, you don&rsquo;t find ostriches here,
do you? I thought the only ones left in Africa were
the domesticated ones on South African farms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ali smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They run wild in the waste places and on the
desert,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Scott,&rdquo; cried Bob, in high excitement, a
sudden thought striking him. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we break the
monotony by having an ostrich hunt? Even if we
don&rsquo;t catch any, it&rsquo;ll be fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To hunt those birds we should have horses,&rdquo;
said Ali, dubiously. &ldquo;They run very swift. With
horses, the hunters pursue them in a great circle,
relays of horsemen relieving the tired ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But won&rsquo;t camels do?&rdquo; Bob was eager to put his
scheme into effect and an appealing note crept into
his voice which caused the kind-hearted Ali to
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can try,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Only you must not be
too disappointed, if you see them run away from
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; promised Bob. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t. Come on,
let&rsquo;s tell everybody,&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>They hurried back to the encampment and Bob&rsquo;s
bellow quickly caused the others to assemble. Then
the news was told. It aroused less enthusiasm than
Bob had looked for. None of the Arabs was keen,
to go, believing that with camels it would be next
to impossible to run any ostrich to ground. Besides,
what would they stand to profit? Ostrich meat is
tough, stringy and practically inedible. The great
bird&rsquo;s sole good to man is to provide feathers for
women&rsquo;s adornment. As for Frank, he planned to
put the finishing touches to the restored radio set
and could not be turned aside from his project. Mr.
Hampton intended to stick by his patient who was
beginning to mutter in his delirium. Most of his
mutterings were in Athensian, which Mr. Hampton
could recognize as such but which was meaningless
to him. But in the midst of Athensian words, he
believed he could distinguish an occasional French
word, and this puzzled and interested him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bob, disappointed, &ldquo;if nobody else
goes, Ali and I will go it alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack grinned. &ldquo;Count me in, old thing,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m as keen as you for a little excitement. Only
thing is, I hate to ride those dratted camels. But
what must be, must be. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>Three camels were brought up, accordingly, and
saddled, and then Ali, Bob and Jack mounted and
ambled away. Mr. Hampton accompanied them
to the edge of the desert, warning them to look out
that they did not come to close quarters with an infuriated
ostrich, especially if by any chance they
were unarmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These African ostriches stand seven or eight
feet tall, boys,&rdquo; he warned, &ldquo;and they have tricky
tempers. If by any chance you become dismounted
and an ostrich charges, throw yourself flat on the
sand and stay there. Then the ostrich can&rsquo;t kick
you. He&rsquo;ll probably sit on you, but hold your position
until one of your comrades can come up and
shoot him. Remember, the ostrich kicks forward
or sidewise, and a blow from his powerful leg can
cave in a man&rsquo;s head or break a horse&rsquo;s leg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Dad, we&rsquo;ll be careful,&rdquo; promised Jack,
&ldquo;but it&rsquo;s hardly likely we&rsquo;ll ever get to close quarters.
I imagine when the ostriches see us coming, they&rsquo;ll
give a flirt of their tails and sail away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the time taken for saddling up and getting
started, the ostrich herd had moved eastward and
now was out of sight, even through the glasses. Ali
led for the place where they had been seen, and as
they rode gave the boys a little homily on the great
birds they hoped soon to stalk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Ostriches are found throughout Africa, except in
the central and coastal regions of great forests.
Especially do they haunt the waste places and
deserts, where stunted bushes furnish sufficient food
for their needs. Their hardihood and fleetness
makes life possible where other animals could not
exist. Even sand and pebbles apparently can be
digested by them, and it is a fact that the domesticated
ostriches of farms and zoos have been known
to swallow glass, barbed wire, bright-colored bits
of metal, bed springs, and other similar objects.</p>
<p>Unfit for food, these great birds are valued because
of their beautiful feathers, which can be
plucked at certain seasons of the year without harm
to them. For this reason, the Arabs of northern
Africa and the colonists of South Africa for long
have domesticated ostriches. In South Africa alone,
latest estimates were that the number of domestic
ostriches was between 800,000 and 900,000. Ostrich-raising
also has been introduced into California and
Arizona with varying success. One of the chief
worries of the ostrich raiser is proper incubation of
the eggs, which take at least forty days to hatch
and more frequently a full seven weeks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>In their wild state, the ostriches lay their nests
of great eggs&mdash;ivory white in color among the birds
of the Sahara, mottled among those of Basutoland
and South Africa&mdash;on the top of a sand dune,
whence they can see in all directions and guard
against surprise. The male takes his turn with the
female in sitting on the nest. Jackals, drawn by
the chance of obtaining some of these eggs, almost
invariably haunt the ostriches. When an unguarded
nest is found, the jackal pushes a big egg up the
sand slope with his nose and then lets it roll down
into the nest. Coming into contact with another
egg, usually both become cracked. Then the jackal
sucks the contents. There is so little on the desert
to feed the jackal that the dangers he runs from the
attack of an infuriated ostrich are braved in order
to obtain such a succulent feast. Observers have
reported seeing a jackal pursued by an ostrich and
running in zigzag fashion for his burrow. If he
fails to reach it in time, one swipe of the ostrich&rsquo;s
leg tosses him yards away and disembowels him.</p>
<p>When the desert people conduct an ostrich hunt,
it is for the purpose of capturing birds to be incorporated
into their herds. They go out in numbers
on fleet horses, circle widely to fixed stations, and
the chase begins. The fleeing ostrich for a time can
outrun the swiftest horse. Therefore, the pursuer
keeps going until his horse lags, whereupon he
gives way to another horseman. A desert creature,
strangely enough the ostrich is not inured to great
heat, and sometimes when being pursued under a
hot sun will suddenly keel over, dead of apoplexy.</p>
<p>Some of the above Ali explained to the boys as
they lurched forward on camel-back. It was not
their intention to kill an ostrich, but, if possible, to
capture one. For this purpose, Ali had provided
lengths of rope, weighted at each end, which if well
cast would wrap around the legs of an ostrich and
bring it down. Bags to be clapped over the head
also had been provided. Ali smiled discreetly to
himself, however, realizing that on camel-back and
without practise, it was next to impossible that
either Jack or Bob would succeed in bagging an
ostrich.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>The latter pair, however, while resolved to do
their best, given the opportunity, were under no illusion,
either. They did not count on capturing an
ostrich. What they sought was a closer view of
them, a chase and the attendant excitement. That
would repay them for the trip, would provide a welcome
break in the dullness of their days.</p>
<p>Before leaving, each had taken with him a small
radio receiving set, fastened in the crown of the
solar topee or sun hat. It differed materially from
the set Frank had borne on camel back as they
approached the oasis, and over which they had
received Professor Souchard&rsquo;s last message. This
set was built on a small panel fastened on the inside
of the sun helmet. To use it, it would be necessary
to halt and set up an aerial and bury a ground. The
ground, a small mass of zinc, was carried slung to
Bob&rsquo;s saddle, and the aerial&mdash;seventy-five feet of
thin wire, hung coiled in the same place. A pair
of jointed steel rods, of special construction, both
light and durable, was strapped to his rifle scabbard.
Before returning, it was planned to set up the aerial,
and test whether Frank had succeeded in repairing
the Professor&rsquo;s sending station.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>Presently, surmounting a sand dune slightly in
advance of the others, while Bob and Jack still
struggled up its sliding slopes, Ali placing the
glasses to his eyes saw the ostriches due east and
about a mile and a half away. He dropped back
at once, cautioning the boys to stay beside him
rather than surmount the dune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ostriches have very good sight, and almost as
good hearing,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;I will stay here, and
do you two work to right and left of me under
shelter of these sand dunes until you judge we have
the herd encircled. Then I&rsquo;ll approach and start
them. You keep your stations until I turn over the
chase to one or other of you. The ostriches will
run in a wide circle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m off.&rdquo; And he started
away to the left.</p>
<p>With a wave of the hand, Jack set out to the right,
little dreaming of the momentous events to occur
before he saw Bob again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><span class="small">BOB&rsquo;S FIGHT AGAINST ODDS.</span></h2>
<p>As Bob rode along on camel-back in the lee of
the sand dunes, there was never a thought of
danger in his mind. The Sahara is not like the
great grassy steppes of Siberia or the plains of
western America, which are flat and level as a table
top and across which one can see for miles in every
direction. On the contrary, this great African
desert is filled with shifting sand dunes, low hills
of sand, which are whipped away when the strong
winds blow and change their position, piling up in
new drifts.</p>
<p>In appearance it was now to Bob&rsquo;s eye like the
sea when waves were kicking up. In the trough
of these sandy waves he made his way forward,
exercising care in advancing from the shelter of
one dune to another to keep below the crests.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>It was lonesome riding, under the baking sun,
in that land of stillness, without sign nor sound of
any human being. He had an eerie feeling, as if
something were about to happen. But he shook
this off, and laughed at himself. Merely a touch
of nerves, he thought, due to the loneliness of the
surroundings.</p>
<p>Before setting out, it had been decided he and
Jack would have to ride a good half hour away
from their starting point, from the place where Ali
was posted, before they would be in the proper
position. Therefore, looking at his watch now and
again, he kept on without exposing himself to gain
sight of the ostrich herd, until the full half hour
had elapsed. It seemed to him a much longer time,
and if it had not been for his watch he would have
been tempted several times to clamber up a sand
dune and look around.</p>
<p>When at length, the allotted time having elapsed,
he did urge his camel up the top of the nearest
sand dune, there was no sign either of ostriches or
of his companions. Far in the distance could be
seen the tops of the palm trees of the oasis, dwarfed
and beautiful as a painting against the blue sky.
All else was hidden from his sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shucks,&rdquo; thought Bob, &ldquo;in dodging to keep
below the tops of the sand hills, I must have gotten
off my course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That, in reality, was what had occurred. Instead
of the small circle he had planned to make, which
would have put him on the point of an arc a third
of the way around the herd from Ali&rsquo;s station, he
had borne off the course gradually but surely in his
attempts to remain hidden. Moreover, he had
gotten into a region of larger sand dunes, so big
they amounted to low hills.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows,&rdquo; he grumbled aloud, wanting to
hear his own voice for the sense of oppression had
grown stronger, &ldquo;who knows, the ostriches may be
over the next dune or so, and I just can&rsquo;t see them
from here. Well, there&rsquo;s the oasis, and I can make for
it if worse comes to worse. But I&rsquo;d feel like a jackass
to go back and say I went and got myself lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke he was swinging the glasses slowly
over the surrounding country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound the luck,&rdquo; he grumbled again, when
unrewarded, &ldquo;believe I&rsquo;ll fire a shot or two. If Ali
or Jack hears, he&rsquo;ll answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unlimbering his repeating rifle, he threw it to his
shoulder, aiming for the crest of a nearby sand
dune, and pressed the trigger. The report followed,
and a spurt of sand showed the accuracy of his aim.
Again he pressed the trigger. But this time the
gun failed to be discharged.</p>
<p>In surprise, Bob bent down to examine it. What
could be the matter? Evidently, the mechanism had
become jammed. Must have forgotten to clean it,
and, perhaps, the all-pervasive desert sand had
clogged it. A pretty note, he thought, and experienced
a momentary feeling of panic. What if
it had happened at a time when he needed it to
protect his life? The thought made him shudder,
and glance around quickly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>Then a sight met his eyes at which words failed
him. For a moment, he sat as if paralyzed, unable
to move or even to think.</p>
<p>Ten horsemen had filed silently, soundlessly, from
behind the shoulder of the sand dunes in his rear.
They were already almost upon him. From
momentary paralysis, Bob&rsquo;s mind leaped into lightning-like
activity. He saw his escape toward Ali
and Jack was cut off on one side, and on the other
his retreat toward the oasis.</p>
<p>It would be useless to attempt to flee, for his
camel soon would be overtaken by the swifter
horses, if he were not shot down in the meantime.
For that first swift appraising glance assured him
these men were armed with long Arab rifles.</p>
<p>In the same glance, he noted something else which
made his heart skip a beat. These men, tanned
though they were, were recognizable as white men.
And they were dressed exactly as was the wounded
Athensian, lying delirious at the oasis, in fact they
were Athensians, in short toga-like garments, bare
legs and soft leather moccasins.</p>
<p>All these observations and thoughts passed
through Bob&rsquo;s mind in a moment. He had a wild
idea of throwing himself from his camel, causing
the latter to kneel, and from behind it, as from
behind a bulwark, fighting off the attackers. For,
that they intended harm to him, Bob felt assured.
But even in the moment of leaping from the saddle,
he realized the futility of such procedure. His rifle
was out of commission.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>What should he do? The party was closing in.
Bob gave one wild searching glance to the south,
where he had left Ali and Jack. They were
nowhere in sight. Neither, for that matter, were
the ostriches.</p>
<p>Under other circumstances, Bob would have made
a fight for his liberty with his bare hands. Those
of our readers who have followed his career under
other skies know well what a superb wrestler is
Bob. And with the additional weight and strength
of an added year or two, Bob was now a wrestler
and boxer second to none. But even as the thought
of grappling with the leader entered his head, he
saw by the loosening of rifles in the hands of others
that his first movement would bring a swarm of
bullets his way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>Or would they shoot? A new idea came to Bob.
In this still desert air, the sound of shots would
carry far. If his one lone shot of a minute before
were to be succeeded by a volley, Ali and Jack would
take alarm, and perhaps even back at the oasis the
alarm would be given. This party consisted only
of ten men. Perhaps, they preferred moving soundlessly
rather than run the risk of bringing a party
of equal strength upon them. Perhaps, they would
not use their rifles at first, should he attack their
leader, expecting to see him overcome. Well, if
they only withheld their fire until he could grasp
the rascal and seize his rifle, Bob wouldn&rsquo;t care.
With a weapon in his hand, he could go down
fighting. What a fool he was, anyway, to have left
the oasis without his automatic.</p>
<p>One phase of the situation which Bob did not
take into account was that, even if Ali and Jack
managed to discover his predicament and either
came to his rescue themselves or set out to rouse
the oasis, the attacking party could escape because of
the greater swiftness of their horses as compared to
camels.</p>
<p>Instead, as the leader of the attackers approached&mdash;a
strikingly handsome young man, with
a round firm face, hawklike nose and crisping brown
hair, Bob set himself for a flying leap from the
camel. The leader rode slightly in advance of the
others, who mounted the sliding sand hill in a semicircle
behind him, toward Bob sitting his camel on
the top of the hill. Then an astonishing thing
happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Attendez, monsieur</i>,&rdquo; called the leader, in
French. &ldquo;It will be useless to resist.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>Now Bob had studied French. In fact, he could
manage a conversation both in French and Spanish,
although somewhat better in the latter language because
of the opportunities he had to learn it at first
hand when in South America, as narrated in &ldquo;The
Radio Boys Search for the Inca Treasure.&rdquo; But
hearing French from the lips of this Athensian
almost bowled him from his seat in surprise.</p>
<p>Yet Bob was not so certain of the folly of
resistance. He believed he had weighed the situation,
and he was willing to take a chance. He was
sitting his camel sidewise to the approaching party.
The off leg he had slowly brought up to the point
where a quick fling would free it of the saddle. Pressing
his left foot down hard into the awkward stirrup,
he suddenly gave a spring upward and outward.
At the same time he brought his right leg over the
saddle. Forward he launched, as if shot from a
catapult. His one hundred and ninety pounds of
bone and muscle struck the young Athensian on the
shoulder with irresistible force, as Bob hurtled the
five-foot gap separating them.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the big fellow sent his useless
rifle crashing into the face of the nearest Athensian
rider to the rear and slightly to the right side of
the leader. The latter was knocked out of his
saddle.</p>
<p>Bob&rsquo;s arms went out as he struck the body of the
leader, and they closed convulsively about him.
Thus, as the young Athensian was hurled from his
saddle by the force of the blow, Bob was dragged
along. He fell on top of his victim, knocking all
the fight out of him. The other lay still and inert.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>A bit dazed himself, but with his wits still about
him, Bob scrambled to his feet as the frightened
horse of the Athensian leader dashed wildly into a
rider approaching from the left. In a twinkling
there was a pretty mix-up of horsemen, shouts and
shrill screams. But in his primary object, which
was to possess himself of the leader&rsquo;s rifle, Bob had
failed. The weapon had been tossed some distance
away in the impact, and as he gazed around him it
could not be seen.</p>
<p>Three or four horsemen were in a tangle where
the bolting animal had created panic, and evidently
were devoting their attention not alone to regaining
control of their own mounts but also to securing the
runaway. Another man lay writhing on the ground,
where he had been knocked by the force of Bob&rsquo;s
rifle flung into his face. The leader lay at Bob&rsquo;s
feet.</p>
<p>But four horsemen still remained clear of entanglements,
and they were closing in on Bob on
three sides. He would have to act quickly. What
was to be done? Retreat to the summit and attempt
to regain the saddle of his camel, which over his
shoulder he could see standing immovable despite all
the commotion? No, too awkward to get back on
that clumsy beast, and besides he could not outdistance
the pursuers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>Now, if he only had a horse. Quickly as thought,
Bob with a tremendous tensing of his leg muscles
beneath him, and gathering up his flowing burnoose
about his waist, leaped a full five feet in the air, as
the nearest of the approaching horsemen came
broadside on and reached out to clutch his hair. The
meaning of the man&rsquo;s movement did not escape
Bob, even in this crisis. Evidently, he was to be
taken prisoner, but he was not to be killed. Otherwise
a shot could quite easily have ended the fight.</p>
<p>Bob&rsquo;s leap disconcerted the other, and Bob&rsquo;s arms,
closing about his waist from the rear, almost pulled
him from the saddle. But the Athensian clung
desperately, knees gripping tight and one hand
clinging to the high horn of the saddle, and thus,
as the horse leaped ahead in fright, the Athensian
retained his seat while Bob pulled himself up behind
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoop-ee,&rdquo; yelled Bob, enjoying himself to the
full, and taking an animal delight in the fight. The
blood in his veins sang in exultation. The heady
wine of success against odds had intoxicated him.</p>
<p>Now to turn the horse for the oasis and flee, with
his captive.</p>
<p>The next moment a crashing blow descended on
his head from the rear, and he pitched forward
against the Athensian. In a unconquerable haze
against which he fought but without success, he felt
himself falling, and then felt strong arms encircle
him from the side and lower him to the ground.
The next moment he lost consciousness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX.
<br /><span class="small">A PUZZLING PROPHECY.</span></h2>
<p>For a long time before regaining full consciousness,
Bob was confusedly aware of pain. He had
nightmare impressions, the sort of feelings one
experiences in a dream when undergoing frightful
experiences from which he is unable to free himself.
To Bob it was as if he lay on a torture wrack, arms
and legs pinioned, and head held in a vise. Try
as he would to reach up a hand to free his head of
the oppression it was impossible to do so. The
stars seemed to whirl around him, each with the
face of an Athensian, mocking him, while a red
devil in a filmy cloud who seemed to bear a striking
resemblance to the fallen Athensian leader hovered
just above the tip of his nose, laughing at him.</p>
<p>All around the edges of his world&mdash;this world
of pain of which he was the center&mdash;lay a thick
cloud which his vision could not pierce. In it came
and went the Athensian-faced stars.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>Once he struggled back to full consciousness. His
eyes opened and he was able to note his surroundings.
Then he saw that he was bound to the saddle
of his camel, lying forward, almost on his chest.
His hands and feet were tied, and many lashings
around his body prevented him from slipping off.
He even was able to note that the lashings consisted
of the rope lassoo with weighted ends with
which he had planned to bring down an ostrich,
supplemented by the coil of wire for aerial and
ground, which had hung looped to his saddle.</p>
<p>On his head was his solar hat or sun helmet, at
which he wondered dazedly. Evidently, the blow
which had felled him had been broken by the helmet.
Perhaps, even, it had fallen on the jutting rear brim,
and thus had not crushed against his skull the little
radio receiving set cunningly inserted in the crown
so that to a casual glance it seemed merely a part
of the helmet. If so&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>But then consciousness failed, and Bob sank again
into the nightmare of the wrack and the torture.</p>
<p>When again he was restored to consciousness, the
rope and wire bindings holding him in the saddle
had been loosed and strong hands were lifting him
to the ground, which was no great distance away
as the camel had been compelled to lie down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>As his feet touched the ground, Bob attempted
to stand, but his legs buckled under him and he
would have fallen were it not for the hands beneath
his armpits. He was lowered to the ground, and
lay there with eyes closed while those who had
assisted him moved away. He could hear the soft
swish of their moccasined feet in the sand.</p>
<p>Cautiously, when he believed himself alone, Bob
opened his eyes and found himself staring up in
the crown of his sun helmet, which had been placed
on his face. Yes, the blow had not wrecked the
little radio set, which he could see in the crown. At
least, he could discern the panel on which the instruments
were placed, and which formed the bottom
of the set. The blow had fallen on the rear brim,
which was crushed and splintered.</p>
<p>Bob still felt excruciating pain on the back of his
head, but came to the conclusion that the softening
of the blow had saved him from a crushed skull and
that in a day or two he would be all right.</p>
<p>Through this hole in the brim, resting on the tip
of his nose, he could see a portion of his surroundings.
The light was fading. Evidently, twilight
had come. Bob wondered at that, which meant he
had been riding all, or at least the better part of,
the day.</p>
<p>A halt had been called, and in the line of his
vision Bob could see a fire just beginning to blaze,
and the bare legs of men coming and going about
it. There were no tents, and Bob&rsquo;s first conclusion,
namely that they had halted at an encampment of
other Athensians, evidently was incorrect. The
few figures, and the absence of such noises as would
attend a large camp, were assurance that no additions
had been made to the party.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>Speculation as to what would be his fate took
possession of Bob, as he again closed his eyes to
ease the pain behind them. That he had been captured
for a purpose was apparent. Otherwise, when
he had put up his heroic fight, he would have been
killed. Well, at least he was to be let live; for a
while, anyhow. That was something. While there was
life, he told himself, there was no need to despair.</p>
<p>Bob wondered what had become of Jack and Ali.
Were they aware of his predicament? Had they
seen him captured and carried away, and would Mr.
Hampton set out to rescue him? Or was his fate
unknown, and the outcome of his adventure
dependant solely on his own exertions? Would
Mr. Hampton give him up for lost and eventually
carry out his plan to abandon the expedition and return
to civilization?</p>
<p>All these questions and many more passed through
Bob&rsquo;s brain as he lay there on the ground, while
the blood slowly worked its way through his cramped
limbs and he felt every minute a return of strength
and even noted a diminution of the pain in his head.
He was thankful that, at least, he had not been incapacitated
physically, that apparently his strength
and the use of his body was left him. When the
time came for a break for freedom, he told himself
grimly, he&rsquo;d show these Athensians.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>At that moment, through the hole in the brim of
his sun helmet, just as he again opened his eyes, he
saw the legs of a man approaching. Then a hand
grasped him by an arm and shook him, and the hat
was lifted from his eyes. Bending over him was an
Athensian, a sturdy, stockily built fellow, who
jerked at his arm and indicated by signs that he
was to rise to his feet.</p>
<p>Bob struggled to comply, pretending to greater
weakness than really possessed him. He figured
that if he appeared to be in a weaker state than was
the case, his chances for escape would be increased.</p>
<p>The man passed an arm around Bob and placed
one of Bob&rsquo;s arms over his shoulders, and then
walked him the few steps toward the fire. The
other Athensians were seated about it, among them
Bob noted with a grim reflection of satisfaction one
with his face almost entirely obscured by a bandage.
That must be the fellow who had felt the weight of
his rifle, and had, in fact, been bowled from his
saddle by it. To their rear, among a patch of stunted
bush, were hobbled the horses. The leader, the one
whom Bob had leaped upon in his jump from camelback,
sat a little withdrawn from the others, leaning
against a saddle.</p>
<p>Bob was led to him, and with a word in an unknown
tongue the leader dismissed the Athensian
who bowed profoundly and withdrew.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; commanded the leader, again employing
French, and indicating a spot at his feet.</p>
<p>Bob complied. For several moments there was
silence, while both young men studied each other.
Bob&rsquo;s first thought was that this Athensian was
little older than himself, a man of perhaps twenty-three
or twenty-four. Bob was twenty-one.</p>
<p>In appearance, the Athensian had a pleasing face.
His eyes, bright blue, twinkled. The bold hawklike
nose gave him an air of command, even of nobility.
It was hard to judge from the seated figure, but
Bob&rsquo;s surmise was that the other was over the middle
height, probably five feet nine or ten.</p>
<p>In his eyes was an expression of satisfaction as
the Athensian ran his glance over Bob&rsquo;s figure, and
the first words uttered by either was his sudden
remark, shot at Bob:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur is very strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sounded as if he were going to be a good sport
about that leap upon him, thought Bob, and he
grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I muss you up much?&rdquo; he asked in his best
French, in reply. &ldquo;Nothing personal, you know. I
was fighting for my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Athensian nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two ribs were broken when monsieur fell on
me,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, that&rsquo;s pretty tough,&rdquo; commiserated Bob.
&ldquo;Makes it hard for you when riding, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>A shrug of the shoulders was the other&rsquo;s sole
reply, while he continued to stare at Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur is, perhaps, an athlete, yes?&rdquo; he asked,
with rising inflection. &ldquo;He participates in college
sports?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mighty chummy of him, thought Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a little,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur is too modest,&rdquo; the Athensian said
suavely. &ldquo;Doubtless, he is a great man among the
youth of his land. Is it England? Monsieur is not
French nor Spanish. Then he must be English. I
have heard the English are fine sportsmen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; blurted Bob. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an American. In our
country we have as good sports as in England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An American?&rdquo; queried the Athensian, in a tone
of enlightenment. &ldquo;Then how comes monsieur in this
far country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob did not reply. What could he say? He was
puzzled by the Athensian&rsquo;s attitude? Asking him
about sports first, and then demanding how he came
to be here in the Sahara. Besides, how did this
Athensian happen to be speaking French, when he
lived in a hidden city unknown to the world? Bob
decided it would not come amiss for him to ask a
question or two by way of continuing the conversation.
So he smiled at the other, and said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;How do I happen to be here?&rdquo; With a laugh:
&ldquo;Oh, just hunting ostriches when you bagged me.
What was the meaning of that, anyway? You don&rsquo;t
look like a robber. And how is it you speak French
so well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Athensian bent a stern gaze on Bob. The
twinkle died out of his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur was not merely hunting ostriches,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Yes, perhaps, at the moment. But he came here
to meet a scientific man who had blundered upon the
secret of those mountains, <i>ne c&rsquo;est pas</i>? Is it not so?&rdquo;
With a quick wave of his hand he indicated the
Shaitun Mountains on the southern horizon, just
dimly seen in the last of the fading twilight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; continued the Athensian, &ldquo;monsieur will
be well advised to answer me truthfully. We do
not want intruders in those mountains, whence I
come. We are not ready yet to receive visitors.
And monsieur came to pry into our privacy. Yet
it was not for that he has been captured, but for his
thews.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My what?&rdquo; Bob stared open-mouthed, scarcely
able to believe his ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The strong men among the slaves were not satisfactory
this year,&rdquo; said the other cryptically.
&ldquo;Monsieur is a good fighter. Yes, he will fight well.
He will be well cared-for and be given his chance to
distinguish himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob stared at the cynical, laughing face of the
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur will learn all in good time,&rdquo; replied
the Athensian. &ldquo;Now he shall eat, and afterwards
he shall answer my questions about his companions.&rdquo;
He clapped his hands, and an Athensian guard
approached. The leader indicated Bob was to be
led away and fed. &ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; he called, &ldquo;monsieur
will answer truthfully, or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He left the
sentence unfinished. But Bob smelled the threat of
torture, just the same.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X.
<br /><span class="small">SQUELCHED BY AN OSTRICH.</span></h2>
<p>Unlike Bob, Jack after leaving Ali took cautious
observations from time to time to enable him to
keep the ostrich herd in sight. He realized the
possibility of being deflected from his course in
passing behind the sand dunes, but by frequent halts
when he would compel his camel to kneel and, retaining
the long led rope so as to prevent the
animal&rsquo;s wandering, climb to the top of a sand dune,
and lying there, swing his glasses on the distant
birds, he managed to make a wide arc about the
herd without going astray.</p>
<p>When a half hour had elapsed, he rose into sight
as agreed and a moment later saw, through his
glasses, Ali making for the ostrich herd. Then he
swung his glasses again over the horizon in the
direction where Bob was supposed to have taken
post. But he was unable to see any sign of his
comrade.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>A somewhat higher mass of dunes far off the
course and more distant caught his eye, and he entertained
the fleeting thought that, perhaps, Bob
in wandering behind the sand dunes had gotten
mixed up among the distant hills. But he had little
time for reflection because at that moment he saw
Ali start off in pursuit of the ostrich nearest him
who, seeing his approach, headed away fleetly into
the desert.</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s first impulse was to dash forward and join
in the chase himself, but he remembered Ali&rsquo;s
caution and held his position. Ali&rsquo;s camel was on
a tangent to the flight of the ostrich, and Jack could
see his companion&rsquo;s intention was to head off the
big bird and chase it toward him. In the meantime,
the more distant members of the herd, a dozen great
birds, had taken alarm and were galloping away on
a course that lay midway between Ali and Jack,
whom apparently they had now sighted.</p>
<p>What a picture it all made, thought Jack. For a
while, he sat his camel, lost in admiration of the
sight. The vast waving floor of the desert, with
here and there low clumps of bush; the great birds,
black-bodied, beautiful under the flood of golden,
dazzling sunlight, fleeing fleetly in twenty-five foot
bounds; apart from his fellows the one great ostrich,
gradually drawing closer to Jack, with the ungainly
camel humping along in the rear and to one side,
continually turning the ostrich so he could not
gain the open desert behind Jack&rsquo;s camel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>In the midst of his absorption, Jack started.
Was that a shot? He listened. But no repetition
came. So faint had been the sound that, perhaps,
his ears had deceived him. Certainly, if it were
a shot it could come only from Bob, yet Bob was
not in sight. And just as certainly as Bob would
shoot, if he were lost, he would fire a whole volley.
Jack listened with strained attention. Not a sound.
He swept the whole northern horizon, in the
direction Bob had taken, with his glasses.</p>
<p>What was that on the far sand dunes? On those
slightly higher hills? A sudden, quick uptossing
movement, and then nothing further. He gazed
fixedly at the spot, but without reward.</p>
<p>A sudden shout from Ali recalled Jack to his
surroundings. Great Scott, what was that! Yes,
Ali&rsquo;s camel had stumbled and pitched to its knees,
and Ali had been thrown forward onto the sand.
And the ostrich! What in the world was it doing?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lie down, Ali, lie down,&rdquo; screamed Jack, remembering
his father&rsquo;s warning of what a man
must do if attacked by an ostrich.</p>
<p>For the great bird which Ali had been pursuing
had turned in wild fury and was dashing headlong
for the fallen man, literally skimming the earth,
seeming to touch it only at long intervals. Jack
knew the ostrich cannot use its wings to fly, and
employs them only to aid to pivot and make sharp
turnings or to bring its body to a sudden halt.
But the great bounds made by the creature gave it
the semblance of flight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s face went white. Ali&rsquo;s camel had scrambled
to its feet and was heading back across the desert
toward the distant oasis. Ali lay still, outspread on
his face. Was he knocked out by the fall, or had
he adopted the customary attitude of hunters when
attacked by an ostrich? Jack could not tell.</p>
<p>One more swoop the ostrich took, and then it
folded its great legs beneath it and sat down on
Ali&rsquo;s body. Only the man&rsquo;s feet and lower legs
projected. The big bird&rsquo;s body covered even his
head, and Jack knew he must act quickly or Ali
would be smothered.</p>
<p>He was less than a thousand yards distant and
well within the range of his Winchester, but so
nervous was Jack, his hands shook so much, that
he decided to approach closer before venturing a
shot.</p>
<p>As he moved up, the ostrich began to hiss. A
strange hissing note it was, with the beak not
opened and the air from the bird&rsquo;s lungs swelling
its throat and flowing over the vocal organs. Still
it continued to maintain its position on Ali.</p>
<p>Now was the time. Jack knew it was up to him
to save Ali&rsquo;s life, and the thought exerted a steadying
influence. He lifted his rifle, took careful aim,
and pressed the trigger. He had aimed not at the
body, for he feared that, unless struck in the heart,
the ostrich would not be killed. Then it would
writhe convulsively, and its movements would increase
Ali&rsquo;s danger. Instead, he aimed at the small head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>The next moment, he saw the head droop like
the head of a flower broken from the stem but still
hanging by a shred. Then the great bird fell over
on its side, and twitched while its long legs kicked
convulsively.</p>
<p>Ali rolled quickly away, turning over and over,
instead of first regaining his feet. By the time
Jack arrived, Ali was on his feet and composedly
shaking sand from his burnoose and straightening
his turban. The swarthy face with its gleaming
black eyes and black mustache, was filled with
gratitude as Jack approached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saved my life,&rdquo; said Ali. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They looked at the body of the great bird, which
lay still. Jack experienced a revulsion of feeling.
Why had they ever come out on this ostrich hunt,
anyway? To kill so beautiful a thing seemed a
crime. Ali looked up at him and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may as well take the plumes now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t want them,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s find
Bob.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>Ali smiled slightly. He could understand his
companion&rsquo;s distaste. As for him, inured to hardships,
was he to be so shaken up by one that he
neglected to pick a small fortune, a tidy sum, in
ostrich plumes? Death of his life, no. He strode
to the body of the ostrich and began methodically
to pull out the barbs of the plumes.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Jack through his glasses scanned
the horizon, searching for signs of Bob. Now
that the danger to Ali was past, recollection of the
fact that no sign of his comrade had yet appeared,
flooded back on him. What could have become of
Bob? Jack was filled with anxiety. Certainly, no
matter whither he had strayed he would have given
some sign ere this. Could his camel have thrown
him? Did he lie stunned somewhere on the desert?
That seemed the most likely possibility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry, Ali,&rdquo; he called, still sweeping his glance
around the desert. &ldquo;We must go and look for
Bob.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ali completed his task, having picked the best
of the plumes, and left the rest to fortune, stirred
by the peremptoriness of Jack&rsquo;s tone. As he walked
nearer, Jack suddenly voiced a low exclamation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What it is?&rdquo; Ali asked. &ldquo;Do you see Mister
Bob?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I saw a man on horseback over there,&rdquo;
said Jack, pointing toward the northeast, where the
ridge of higher sand dunes which earlier had caught
his gaze, lying to the north of him, stretched eastward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A horseman?&rdquo; Ali&rsquo;s tone grew alert. &ldquo;We have
no horses here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now I can&rsquo;t see any more,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Look
here, what&rsquo;ll we do? We&rsquo;ve got to go and look for
Bob. He&rsquo;s strayed, that&rsquo;s all there is to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rapidly he outlined to Ali his fears that Bob had
strayed from his course and became enmeshed
among the higher sand hills, perhaps had been
pitched from his camel. Ali, whose glasses had
been lost in his fall, scouted around until he recovered
them beneath a bush. Then he, too,
examined the sand dunes Jack indicated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That horse you saw,&rdquo; Ali said presently. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Jack demanded quickly.
&ldquo;Desert robbers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Ali. &ldquo;Although this is off the
caravan routes and is not rich ground for robbers.
Perhaps, the Athensians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come now,&rdquo; scoffed Jack. Nevertheless, he,
too, experienced a sudden sense of fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Ali, &ldquo;take me up behind you, and
we&rsquo;ll investigate. Mister Bob&rsquo;s trail ought to be
easy to follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obediently, Jack caused his camel to kneel and
Ali scrambled up behind. Then, with its double
load, Jack turned the beast&rsquo;s head toward the point
where the three earlier had separated. The indentations
made in the sand by the pads of Bob&rsquo;s
camel were easy to follow, and in his anxiety Jack
pushed his own animal ahead at a shuffling run.
Ali perched precariously behind him had hard work
holding on, but said nothing. He was as anxious
as Jack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>In less than the half hour Bob had taken to reach
his station, they arrived. Then the sorry story lay
before them. To Ali&rsquo;s desert-trained eyes, it was
easy to read.</p>
<p>Both Ali and Jack flung themselves from the
camel and went scouting around. Bob&rsquo;s camel
tracks, the hoof marks of horses, a broken piece
out of the shield of Bob&rsquo;s sun helmet, and the mass
of zinc for a ground for his radio set, which had
become detached from his camel&rsquo;s saddle, all told
what had occurred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet old Bob put up a whale of a fight,&rdquo; said
Jack. &ldquo;But why didn&rsquo;t we hear any shots?&rdquo; He
explained about the one shot which he had heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever was here,&rdquo; said Ali, gauging the situation
correctly, &ldquo;wanted to take Mister Bob prisoner,
not to kill him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Bob had his Winchester,&rdquo; objected Jack.
&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t he use it? Either they closed in on
him too fast, or else it became jammed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ali nodded, but did not reply. He was engaged
with other thoughts and in a moment gave Jack
the result of his cogitations.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;A half hour for Mister Bob to arrive here, a
half hour for us to arrive,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Not to speak
of the time lost in our ostrich hunt. These men have
more than an hour&rsquo;s start of us. They are on
horses, and eight or ten in number. We have a
camel, which is slower, and we are only two. It
would be folly to pursue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow or not,&rdquo; said Jack hotly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not let old
Bob be carried off without doing my&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ali held up a hand and interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be a long chase,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We must
organize for it. Let us return to the oasis. There
are ten of us left. Armed, provisioned, mounted
on our camels who have had a long rest, we can
return and pick up the trail before nightfall. Camels
need less rest than horses. Even though they are
slower, by pushing them we may yet cut off these
others, if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gestured toward the distant Shaitun Mountains.
Jack nodded understandingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean if they are Athensians and are
heading home?&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Well, you are right,
Ali. I want to start right away, but your way is
better. Come on, mount, and we&rsquo;ll get back to the
oasis as fast as a camel ever made it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI.
<br /><span class="small">THE STRANGER REVIVES.</span></h2>
<p>Some distance from the oasis, Mr. Hampton and
Frank were encountered, riding to meet them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Bob?&rdquo; called Frank, in an anxious
tone. He and the big fellow were very close.
Frank&rsquo;s mother had died when he was a baby, and
his father, business partner of Bob Temple&rsquo;s father,
had followed her a few years later. Ever since, the
orphaned Frank had made his home with the
Temples, and he was engaged to Bob&rsquo;s sister, Della.</p>
<p>To Frank&rsquo;s anxious inquiry, Mr. Hampton
added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Ali&rsquo;s camel came in alone we knew something
had happened and set out to meet you at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Dad, something has happened all right,&rdquo;
said Jack, dejectedly. &ldquo;Or rather it&rsquo;s all wrong.
Bob has been captured. We don&rsquo;t know how.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>Thereupon, while they all made their way back
to the oasis, he proceeded to explain events as they
had occurred so far as he knew them. What actually
had happened in Bob&rsquo;s case, of course, was not
known. But as our readers know, Jack and Ali
had guessed at the truth.</p>
<p>By the time the account was concluded, they had
arrived at the encampment and dismounted. Mr.
Hampton looked very grave and care-worn. The
deaths of the Professor and Ben Hassim already
had weighted him down. Now the capture of Bob,
whom he loved as if he were a son, filled him with
grief. A malignant, unseen power seemed pursuing
this expedition, which had started out peacefully
intent only on establishing amicable relations with
the mysterious dwellers of the Shaitun Mountains
and on adding to the sum of the world&rsquo;s useful
knowledge. Truly, he thought, gazing out through
the trees of the oasis across the vast reaches of the
desert toward the mountains on the far northern
horizon, truly, they were well named the mountains
of Satan.</p>
<p>Had he had any premonition of the reception
with which they would meet at the hands of the
Athensians, Mr. Hampton never would have
financed nor launched the expedition. But he
realized the futility of vain regrets. Now was not
the time to devote to such thoughts. One thing
must be done, one thing alone, and done at once;
that was, to start swift pursuit for the purpose of
rescuing Bob.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>Turning to the boys, he bade them pack up at
once the few things absolutely necessary, but not to
incommode themselves with articles which could
be dispensed with. As they leaped to obey, he
ordered Ali to summon the Arabs. The men who
already had received from Ali a brief account of
what had occurred on the ostrich hunt, quickly
assembled. Their swarthy determined faces formed
a group at which Mr. Hampton looked with approval.
Picked men all, he could not ask for better
support at his back. Nevertheless, he felt it was
only fair that they should be appraised fully of the
dangers attendant upon the proposed expedition,
and should be allowed to exercise their own choice
as to whether to accompany him or not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ali,&rdquo; he said, when all the men were assembled,
&ldquo;I want you to tell these men that I am going to
start at once in pursuit of the band which has taken
Bob prisoner. If we can cut the fugitives off before
they reach the Shaitun Mountains or catch up with
greater numbers, as it is possible another band
awaits them, we stand a good chance of rescuing
Bob. But, as I say, it is quite possible this small
band of ten men was merely an offshoot of a larger
band. In that case, the others may turn on us and
we could not outrun them and would have to make
a fight for it. Against any such band as that which
swept the oasis the night the Professor was killed,
we would stand little chance for our lives. Therefore,
I think it only right that the men should make
their own choice as to whether they go with me or
await my return here. If none go, I&rsquo;ll still make
the attempt at rescue with my son and Mr. Frank.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>Ali listened impassively, and on the conclusion
of Mr. Hampton&rsquo;s little speech turned to his comrades
whom he addressed briefly. Mr. Hampton
watched their faces as Ali was speaking. What
he saw pleased him mightily. A sharp fierce cry,
coming as if from one throat, issued from the group
at the conclusion of Ali&rsquo;s words. He turned to
Mr. Hampton with a satisfied smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They all go,&rdquo; he said simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Mr. Hampton, not a little affected.
&ldquo;Good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say Mr. Bob is worth dying for,&rdquo; added
Ali. &ldquo;Every man loves him. If there is a fight
and they die, well, you know, sir, Paradise awaits
the Arab who falls in battle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton nodded, unable to trust himself to
speak for a moment, as he thought of Bob and the
devotion of these Arabs to him. Then when he
found his voice he added huskily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If any man dies, I&rsquo;ll provide for his family, Ali,
if he has a family. And to all I&rsquo;ll give double wages
for the entire trip should we get safely back to
civilization. Tell them that, please. Also, I&rsquo;ll give
each man right now, or as soon as I can write it,
an order on the Cairo bankers for 25 pounds (about
$1,250). Thus, if I fall, the men still will be provided
for.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>Ali repeated Mr. Hampton&rsquo;s words, and a hum of
approval rose from the half dozen Arabs. The sum
mentioned was more than any one of them ever
dreamed of possessing at one time, and would
represent affluence, indeed.</p>
<p>While the Arabs, under Ali&rsquo;s direction, sorted
out the equipment to be taken and baled up the
remainder to be left at the oasis in charge of old
Allola, Mr. Hampton retired to his tent to write
the necessary bank drafts. Also, he drew up a document
for his Cairo bankers, incorporating the
provisions of his pledge to the Arabs, which he
intended to leave with Allola, with explicit instructions
that it should be sent out of the desert by the
first trustworthy rider who should appear at the
oasis.</p>
<p>To Allola, he made a handsome present in money.
As for the old woman&rsquo;s welfare, she had the sheep
and goats, the garden patches, the fig trees, and
would not suffer for sustenance, should they fail
to return. Soon or later some Bedouins of the
desert would arrive at the oasis, moreover. And,
as, despite her age, the old woman was spry and
could get about easily, she had little to fear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Disposition of the wounded Athensian puzzled
Mr. Hampton. All day the man had been tossing
and muttering at a great rate, and Mr. Hampton
believed that the fever was leaving him and that in
another day or two he would recover consciousness
and could be questioned. Even as he wrote, he was
conscious of the other man muttering on the divan
behind him.</p>
<p>Going to the door, Mr. Hampton called Allola to
him and into her care gave the papers he had drawn
with explicit order for their disposal, together with
a sum of money not only for herself but for the
messenger she should select. Of the old woman&rsquo;s
honesty and willingness to carry out his orders, he
had no doubt whatsoever, as gratitude for her
rescue made her slave-like in devotion.</p>
<p>He noted the Arabs loading the camels lightly,
and storing the balance of their equipment in one
of the tents. With approval he saw Frank and Jack
putting the Professor&rsquo;s radio sending apparatus, in
its shallow trunk, on one of the camels. There was
always the possibility that it would come in useful,
and Frank had finished restoring it to order only
that morning.</p>
<p>Then while he still talked to Allola Mr. Hampton
heard a sharp cry from the tent, and whirled around.
It had come from the wounded Athensian. With
Allola at his heels, Mr. Hampton hurried to the
other man&rsquo;s side and bent down to look at him. He
gave an exclamation of surprise. The man&rsquo;s eyes
regarded him in puzzled bewilderment, filled with
the light of returning reason. Putting a hand on
his forehead, Mr. Hampton noted it was cool and
moist, indicating the last of the fever had fled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>The other continued to stare at him, unbelievingly,
and Mr. Hampton decided to see if his
prisoner really had been restored to his senses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know where you are?&rdquo; he asked, slowly,
in the Athensian words taught him by Professor
Souchard.</p>
<p>Almost it seemed as if fear leaped into the man&rsquo;s
eyes. Certainly they were filled with amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a stranger who was passing by and saved
you when otherwise you would have died,&rdquo; said Mr.
Hampton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not speak my tongue well,&rdquo; replied the
other slowly. &ldquo;How is it you speak it at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That explanation can wait,&rdquo; said Mr. Hampton.
&ldquo;In the meantime, I have a question or two to ask,
which I hope you will be good enough to answer.
Excuse me, first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a whispered injunction to Allola to stay or
watch, he hurried out of the tent and called Jack,
Frank and Ali to him. Briefly, he explained the
prisoner was conscious, and that they must delay
a few minutes in order that he might be questioned.
It was possible that from him some information of
great value might be obtained.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>Returning, Mr. Hampton found Allola giving
the Athensian a drink from the canvas water jar
which always was kept hanging in the draught at
the doorway so that evaporation kept the water cool.
He was turning over in his mind the possibilities,
and wondering which of the many questions crowding
for answer he should put. His small stock of
Athensian words, moreover, complicated the task.
But the other, palpably refreshed and strengthened
by his drink, solved a portion of his problem by
addressing him in French as he approached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur, doubtless speaks French,&rdquo; said the
Athensian cooly. &ldquo;This knowledge of my language
is deplorable. Let us speak therefore in French.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; said Mr. Hampton. &ldquo;Only, let me
say that your surprise at my partial knowledge of
your language was no greater than mine at hearing
such excellent French from your lips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long have I lain here?&rdquo; asked the man
abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten days,&rdquo; said Mr. Hampton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have cared for me all that time? I
must have been very ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have cared for you,&rdquo; said Mr. Hampton gravely.
&ldquo;And you were ill, very ill, you came close to
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; muttered the Athensian, his eyelids fluttering
shut. They remained so a moment, then
snapped open with the effect of a camera shutter&rsquo;s
quick flicker. Mr. Hampton was surprised at the
vigor of the other&rsquo;s glance. &ldquo;And has no attempt
been made by others to come and get me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None,&rdquo; said Mr. Hampton.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the man once more. Again his eyes
closed. Again they opened, and this time they
seemed filled with ferocity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would monsieur say I had been left as if it were
believed I was dead?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII.
<br /><span class="small">AMRATH SPEAKS.</span></h2>
<p>What all this was leading to Mr. Hampton could
not surmise, but he was content to bide his time a
moment longer, pretty well convinced by now that
the other was leading up to some denouncement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he stated judicially, &ldquo;I would say that
whoever saw you would have considered you dead.
I myself believed so when we discovered you. It
was only after various tests that we were convinced
you still lived, and since then I have had a struggle
to bring you back to sanity and consciousness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suspected it,&rdquo; said the man, grimly. &ldquo;Let me
think a moment monsieur.&rdquo; Again he closed his
eyes. For not only one but several minutes he continued
to lie with his eyes closed, but that he not
only was awake but thinking tumultuous thoughts
was apparent to Mr. Hampton from the flush that
mantled the man&rsquo;s cheeks and from the labored rise
and fall of his chest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said the man, snapping his eyes open
again, &ldquo;you have been good to me. I can see that.
I am not ungrateful. My people attempted to kill
me. They left me for dead. I am convinced of it.
Now I shall foreswear them. I shall be your friend,
as I was the friend of Professor Souchard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Mr. Hampton&rsquo;s turn to exhibit surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Professor Souchard&rsquo;s friend?&rdquo; he queried in
amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another drink I beg you, monsieur,&rdquo; pleaded
the Athensian. Mr. Hampton obediently poured
water from the jar into the cup, and set the latter
to his lips. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the Athensian, satisfiedly,
&ldquo;that is delicious. Already I feel myself growing
much stronger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Mr. Hampton, &ldquo;my time presses.
Some of your people have captured my son,&rdquo; he
added, to avoid needless explanation of Bob&rsquo;s
identity. &ldquo;And I was about to set out in pursuit and
attempt his rescue when you became conscious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tsst, tsst,&rdquo; clucked the other, sympathetically.
&ldquo;That is bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A big fine fellow, six feet tall, an athlete,&rdquo; said
Mr. Hampton, thinking of Bob&rsquo;s fine appearance.
&ldquo;Well, I imagine he mussed up a number before
they took him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An athlete?&rdquo; queried the other, alertly. &ldquo;And
they did not shoot but took him prisoner. Monsieur,
that is very bad, very bad, indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have been here ten days,&rdquo; said the other
thoughtfully, seeming to disregard Mr. Hampton&rsquo;s
question. &ldquo;Yes, the Sacrificial Games, them, are
five weeks, no, six weeks, distant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Mr. Hampton demanded, this time a
sharper note of anxiety in his voice, what the
Athensian sought to convey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just this, monsieur,&rdquo; said the other; &ldquo;that your
son is destined to take part in the annual Sacrificial
Games of my people. Every year twelve of the
strongest men from the outside world who can be
found, either taken prisoner by us in battle or raid, or
bought in the slave mart of Gao, are pitted in single
combat against an equal number of Athensian youth.
The victor in each contest is then pitted against
another victor. Thus the competition is narrowed
until only two remain. These combats are to the
death. The winner is worshipped one whole year
as the embodiment of the God of Strength. At the
time of the annual Sacrificial Games of the succeeding
year he is killed as a sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heaven,&rdquo; said Mr. Hampton. &ldquo;And is
that the reason for this purchase by your people of
the strongest slaves in Gao, of which I have heard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur has heard?&rdquo; queried the other, surprisedly.
&ldquo;Yes, that is the reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stay any longer to talk to you,&rdquo; said Mr.
Hampton, emphatically, springing to his feet. &ldquo;I
must set out at once to rescue Bob.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;But a moment, monsieur,&rdquo; pleaded the other.
&ldquo;I would like to go with you, but I am not strong
enough. See, I cannot more than lift my arm,&rdquo; he
added, suiting action to word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I know,&rdquo; Mr. Hampton said, impatiently.
&ldquo;But I must be off. Allola, this old Arab
woman, will look after you until my return. And
if I fail, well&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; A shrug of the shoulders completed
his sentence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur must not fail if he would see his son
again,&rdquo; the Athensian said. &ldquo;But before you go,
let me explain. I shall be brief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton unwillingly returned and the
Athensian continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I met Professor Souchard on one of his scouting
expeditions about the base of our mountain wall.
I am an exile from Athensi, monsieur. How I come
to speak French is easily explained. I am of the
priest clan, and our young men for ages have been
sent into the outside world for a certain period of
study. Always this has been so. We made our way
into Egypt under the Pharaohs. When Carthage
rose, we were represented there. At the height of
Rome&rsquo;s power, our young men were at her court,
learning the secrets of her civilization and power.
Through each succeeding age, we have gone out
across the desert and entered the halls of learning of
the dominant races of civilization. I was one of
those selected to study the French, and I have
served in the French Foreign Legion in Algiers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then we return after a certain time, not to give
the benefit of our acquired knowledge to our people,
who are steeped in ignorance, being little better than
the Kabyles of Northern Africa, who, as monsieur
doubtless knows, are a semi-savage white race
living in the mountain. No, we exercise this knowledge
to retain our power. Some day there will come
a revolution. I was one of those not contented with
this abuse of power. I felt our country should be
developed, and opened to civilization, surrounded
though it is on every side by the desert. For this, I
was an exile to Korakum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another drink. I beg, monsieur. Ah, that is
better. I draw near the finish of my words. Monsieur,
I see, is anxious to be gone. Well spies of the
Oligarch saw me converse with Professor Souchard
whose first escape from Korakum had been regretted
by the priest clan as a mistake. And heavily did they
punish those who aided him then. Heavily
monsieur. They paid with their lives. For the
priest clan does not wish civilization from the outside
world to enter our mountains, lest the power
of its members be shattered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I have friends. Knowledge that I had been
spied upon in my conversations with Professor
Souchard was not unknown to me. It was only
recently I had met him, on the next to last trip he
made into our region. When he came the last time,
I met him out on the desert and warned him the
expedition which he and you, monsieur&mdash;for I suppose
you are the comrade he awaited&mdash;must turn
back. He had not known before of the priest clan,
nor of all this I have told you so sketchily. He said
he would meet you at this oasis, and that he would
tell you what I told him and go back with you across
the desert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On returning to the mountains, monsieur, I hid
beside the outbound trail. Hours later, a friend
came to me with word that the Athensian spies were
starting with an expedition for the oasis, determined
to kill Professor Souchard and his man, Ben
Hassim, rather than let them escape and bring the
world about our ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a horse. I mounted, and with a bag of
food and several water bottles, set out to overtake
my friend. Five days I rode, not sparing my horse.
Then he dropped dead, and I staggered on the last
half day afoot. But the Athensians overtook me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not killed monsieur. I was carried along
to the oasis with them. At its edge, the world went
black to me.&rdquo; He paused. &ldquo;That is all, monsieur.
What has happened since, you know better than I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton drew a long breath. The spell of
the man&rsquo;s tersely told story had held him enthralled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They garroted Professor Souchard and Ben
Hassim,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The Athensian&rsquo;s lips compressed. &ldquo;A trick of
the priest clan&rsquo;s followers for disposing of enemies,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;And you were hit a blow on the back of the
head, and left for dead beside them. It was there
we found you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the other, composedly. &ldquo;They lied to
me. They said my life would be spared.&rdquo; A long
pause followed, during which he raised a languid
hand to brush his eyes. &ldquo;My name, monsieur,&rdquo; he
added, &ldquo;is Amrath. I have delayed you, but not
for long. Go now, and luck be with you. In the
Valley of Korakum, should you reach it, you will
find true men named Jepthah, Amonasis and Shilluk.
Should it be your fortune to meet them, call upon
them for help in my name. And now, luck be with
you. I shall await your return.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><span class="small">KORAKUM REACHED.</span></h2>
<p>The Athensian&rsquo;s lengthy conversation palpably
had tired him, and Mr. Hampton summoned Allola
who had gone to the door of the tent to watch the
final stages of the Arabs&rsquo; preparations for departure,
and ordered her to prepare broth at once for Amrath.
He also left with the latter one of his precious bottles
of brandy, advising him to sip it sparingly.</p>
<p>Good-byes were said, and he was on the point
of departure. In fact, already he had left the tent
when Allola came running after him, summoning
him in dumb show to return.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>&ldquo;A bit of advice, monsieur,&rdquo; said Amrath. &ldquo;Your
one opportunity to intercept the party bearing away
your son lies not in following their trail. It will be
circuitous in order to pass by three small water holes
in the desert of which we Athensians know. That is
necessary because of the horses. But you, with
your camels, need not strike those water holes.
Take a supply of water in your water bottles, and
strike due south. The only way to enter the mountain
wall is through the old stone road leading into
Korakum. There is another trail, which was
destroyed ages ago, and which we revolutionaries
secretly have been rebuilding. The spies set upon
us recently may have reported that to the Athensian
authorities. But, doubtless, this party will take the
easier route. Therefore, I would advise you to seek
the old road, which lies due south of this oasis and
enters the mountains by the only accessible pass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you arrive in time, seek out Jepthah,
Amonasis and Shilluk in Korakum and with their
aid make an ambush. That is all,&rdquo; he concluded,
faintly, his exertions beginning to show on him.
He clasped Mr. Hampton&rsquo;s outstretched hand and
pressed it to his forehead. &ldquo;Believe me, monsieur,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;I am not ungrateful. Amrath wishes you
well. And, who knows? Together we may yet
bring happiness to my backward country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Making a mental note of the directions given and
especially of the names of the three friendly exiles
of Korakum now twice repeated, Mr. Hampton bade
Amrath farewell. Drawing Allola with him, he
ordered Ali to lay upon her the strictest injunctions
for looking after the Athensian&rsquo;s welfare, stating
the man was a friend. Further, he advised her that
should he fail to return she was to give Amrath on
his recovery the documents left in her possession
and destined for the Cairo bankers, feeling assured
the Athensian would deliver them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>Everything now being ready and Frank and Jack
especially being wild to start, the party set out.
Amrath&rsquo;s advice was repeated to Ali, who nodded
agreement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is good sense,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;If we followed
the trail, as your man says, we might and
probably would be too late. They would escape on
their fleeter horses. But by shortening the distance
to the mountains, we may arrive ahead of the
raiders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Day after day the party now pushed on south into
the desert, resting two hours in the hottest part of
the day but making up for the delay by riding far
into the cooler night. The camels were pushed
almost to the limit of endurance.</p>
<p>Daily the Shaitun Mountains loomed larger on
the southern horizon. A sharp lookout was kept
for sight of other travellers, but none was seen.
Except for the gray shape of an occasional jackal
scuttling off through the bush into his sand burrow,
or a herd of ostrich seen at a distance, nothing
alive appeared in that vast waste of sand dunes and
stunted bush. No trees broke the horizon, once
the oasis of Aiz-Or had been left behind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>This failure to sight the raiders carrying Bob
into captivity was variously interpreted by members
of the party. Mr. Hampton and Ali, older and less
optimistic than the boys, were inclined to believe it
meant that the raiders had too great a lead, due to
their several hours&rsquo; start and their swifter mounts,
and had completely outdistanced them. Jack and
Frank, on the contrary, scorned this interpretation.
To them the absence of any sight of the raiders
meant that the route the others followed was so
circuitous as to be completely below the horizon and
that, accordingly, the chance of reaching the mountains
in advance of the raiders was good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, believe me,&rdquo; said Frank, during the course
of one discussion, &ldquo;when we spring our ambush, if
they show any signs of resistance, I&rsquo;ll have no compunctions
about shooting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;For once in my life
I&rsquo;ll shoot at human beings without a qualm. The
bloody scoundrels. Carrying off old Bob to make
a Roman holiday for &rsquo;em. Either he&rsquo;d be killed in
one of their single combats, or, if he won, he&rsquo;d be
fattened up for a year and then sacrificed to their
idols. Brr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree with you boys,&rdquo; he said, quietly. &ldquo;If we
get the opportunity, we must not throw it away
through faint-heartedness or misplaced kindness.
These Sacrificial Games of which Amrath spoke
constitute a bloody rite which is out of tune with
modern times. The idea of Bob being compelled to
fight for his life, without any real chance of winning,
even if he conquers all others, makes me shudder.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>Jack and Frank were silent a long time, filled with
oppressive thoughts. Yet in the end, a grim smile
spread over Frank&rsquo;s face and he appealed to his
comrade with:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the same, Jack, it would be a great sight to
see old Bob doing the gladiator. He&rsquo;s an expert
fencer, wrestler and boxer. Let them arm him as
they will, he&rsquo;ll put up a real battle. I wouldn&rsquo;t be
surprised if he beat all contenders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bloody-minded barbarian,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;I
believe you&rsquo;d like to see such a contest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;if it can&rsquo;t be avoided, I
want a ringside seat, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton&rsquo;s lips twitched, although he shook
his head in deprecation. Youth must be served, he
knew well. The delight of the three young men in
sports always had seemed to him wholesome and
worth while. From their earliest knee-pants days
he had encouraged them in all sorts of athletic
exercises. They swam like water dogs, ran like
Mercuries, fenced like D&rsquo;Artagnan, and as non-professional
boxers and wrestlers stood high. But of
them all, Bob was the most expert boxer and
wrestler, due in a measure to his greater physical
strength, while, as Frank had said, he was no mean
hand with the foils. Should he be pitted with
sword and shield against almost any warrior, he
would give a good account of himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>Frequently, these rest-period discussions turned
on the question of what should be done if they failed
to intercept the raiders and effect Bob&rsquo;s rescue, as
well as on what plan to follow if the small raiding
party joined hands with a larger Athensian force.</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton was of the opinion that the latter
contingency was quite likely to arise. Apparently,
secure in their sense of isolation, the Athensians
had not maintained outer guards of their mountain
land at the time Professor Souchard first arrived
at Korakum. Otherwise, it would not have
been possible for him to escape. But that now such
a guard was maintained seemed to Mr. Hampton
more than likely.</p>
<p>Against this assumption, however, Jack argued
with great good sense that Amrath would have been
aware of such a guard, and would not have advised
them to attempt to enter Korakum and seek out
his comrades had a guard existed.</p>
<p>The only plan they could reach for use in case
of attack by superior number was to compel the
camels to kneel in a circle and from the interior of
such a fort of living flesh put up the best fight
possible. With their repeating rifles and plenty of
ammunition, it was possible they could inflict such
damage as to compel the withdrawal of the enemy.
If not, well&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If old Bob has got to go, I&rsquo;d just as soon go
with him,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>Jack nodded solemnly.</p>
<p>As for the Arabs, said Ali:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;When we die in battle, we are sure of Paradise.
The Prophet so promised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In case they failed to intercept the raiders and
rescue Bob, Mr. Hampton planned to hunt out first
the Korakum exiles whose names had been given
him by Amrath, and whom he took to be leaders
of the revolutionaries. It was possibly that they
could be induced to aid in some plan for stealing
Bob from Athensi before the holding of the Sacrificial
Games, which Amrath had said were six
weeks away. Failing to gain such aid, Mr.
Hampton believed it possible the exiles might at
least supply information which would enable them
alone to penetrate the enemy&rsquo;s stronghold and try
to rescue Bob. For to this course, Jack and Frank
had declared openly they would commit themselves,
come what would.</p>
<p>And Mr. Hampton knew it was useless to try to
dissuade them. Both were of age and, although
guided by him ordinarily, in this matter they would
act as they saw fit. Either they would rescue Bob
or die in the attempt. The bond of union between
the three inseparables was so sure and firm that Mr.
Hampton would not attempt to go against it, even
though it might mean the loss of his own son. As
a matter of fact, he himself was equally determined
to go the limit in attempting to rescue Bob.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>As matters fell out, they were enabled to make
the last march bringing them to the Shaitun Mountains
entirely under cover of darkness. By saving
their camels the latter half of the day, they covered
the remaining distance at night, and arrived at the
pass&mdash;plainly discerned through Mr. Hampton&rsquo;s
night glasses&mdash;in the early morning hours, before
the sun was up.</p>
<p>Should they enter and hunt cover, or reconnoitre
the mountain wall to either side first? This question
had been left until the last moment for decision, as
naturally the lay of the land would influence them.</p>
<p>On arrival, so gradually did the great stone road
rise out of the sand and pierce the mountain pass,
with bare steep walls on either side, devoid of
verdure, that Mr. Hampton believed it was safe
enough to push ahead. On those great rocky slopes,
where the levelling process of Nature had been assisted
by man in that dim age when the road first
was built, by no possibility could men lie hidden.
At this point they could neither ambush nor be
ambushed.</p>
<p>Before proceeding, however, the sand was inspected
by Arabs afoot for any signs that would
indicate the recent entrance of horsemen into the
pass. None was found. Then the marks left by
the scouts were carefully obliterated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>For a considerable distance, as they approached
the pass, the camels were made to walk in single file,
and two Arabs, walking backward at the rear of the
procession, smoothed out all signs of their passage.
In broad sunlight, anyone hunting for a trail, would
find it. But to a cursory glance it would remain
invisible.</p>
<p>Satisfied that everything possible had been done
to prevent the raiders whom he now felt assured
had not yet entered the pass, from discovering he
was ahead of them, Mr. Hampton ordered the party
to proceed cautiously along the great stone road.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><span class="small">A NEW RADIO STATION.</span></h2>
<p>The moon had been down for two hours or more.
They had so timed their approach as to make the last
part of their journey come at the darkest time of
night, in order to minimize the risk of being seen
by any spies on the mountain.</p>
<p>In the distance, on either hand, stretched away to
the horizon a great mountain mass, the outer walls
of which Mr. Hampton estimated to be 2,000 feet
at least in height. Steep precipitous slopes of rock,
as far as they could judge, made ascent next to
impossible. Here, in this pass, however, the mountain
walls were slightly lower. Yet, as they
proceeded slowly up the stone road, which ascended
gradually but steadily, going carefully, with an
Arab well in the lead as they approached each turn
in order to give warning against surprise, the walls
were steep enough in all seeming.</p>
<p>Conversation had been forbidden, and only the
soft padding of the camels broke the silence. Yet
each man thought to himself that it would be impossible
to scale those slopes, and prepared to fight
to the death where he stood in case of attack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>It was even darker in the pass than it had been
on the desert, where the soft diffusive light of the
stars gave a faint illumination. They rode two
abreast, and Jack and Frank, who rode together,
could make little out of their surroundings. They
were in the middle of the line and could barely see
the men ahead and behind them&mdash;dark, hooded
shapes all. For Mr. Hampton and the boys wore
Arab burnooses and, except for their sun helmets,
which they wore in place of the Arab turban, resembled
their companions in appearance.</p>
<p>Of the road itself little could be seen, except that
it was smooth and without breaks, composed of
immense rocks which could have been moved from a
quarry and put in place only at the expense of Herculean
labor, especially in that dim bygone age when
laid down. Filling the pass from wall to wall, it
was a road built for the ages. How deep it went,
who knew? Certainly, it must have been yards in
depth. Over the surface, one would have expected
sand from the desert to have collected, but so free
was the stone from any such accumulation that it
seemed to be newly-swept. Winds playing up and
down the pass like the draught in a chimney were
responsible.</p>
<p>Suddenly the Arab riding far in the lead to guard
against surprise, as similarly rode a single Arab well
in the rear of the main body, fell back beside Mr.
Hampton and Ali who headed the procession.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Ali, low-voiced. &ldquo;Men
ahead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other whispered softly to him, and Ali turned
to his anxious companion, and interpreted in a
relieved tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Akmet says there is a little pocket ahead in the
canyon wall,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;He cannot see well
because of the darkness. There are trees and
bushes. He will not go in alone. Akmet,&rdquo; said
Ali, in a tone of scorn, &ldquo;does not fear to find men,
but he is afraid of spirits. He wants the Master to
accompany him because he is a great wizard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the darkness, unseen by Ali, Mr. Hampton
smiled. This child-like fear of <i>djinn</i> or spirits he
had noted among the men on other occasions. Early
in their association, whiling away hours in camp as
they crossed the Great Desert toward the oasis, he
had performed some intricate tricks of magic which
had made a great impression on the men. That
they believed him a wizard, he knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;tell Akmet to lead, and
I&rsquo;ll follow. Do the rest of you remain here until
we return.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>Then the forms of the two men melted into the
darkness. A considerable time elapsed before their
return and Jack, alarmed despite the absence of shots
or other sounds which would indicate his father had
encountered trouble, was arguing with Ali who
barred the way to be permitted to go in search, when
his father and Akmet returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the place for us,&rdquo; said Mr. Hampton, in a
tone of satisfaction, still speaking in a low voice.
&ldquo;A little grassy plateau, slightly above the level of
the road and stretching back under a steep overhanging
bulge in the rocky wall of the mountains
as far as we could judge. Some wild fig trees
have grown up there and the grass is luxuriant.
There is a spring of water at the rear. The plateau
is about an acre and a half or two acres in extent,
running back under the rock rather than alongside
the road. The trees will screen us, there is water,
grass for the camels, and we will be protected from
attack overhead. We could make a stand there
against an army, if necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Expressions of satisfaction greeted this announcement,
and with Akmet and Mr. Hampton in the
lead, the whole party, which the rear guard had
joined during its halt, proceeded to the retreat.</p>
<p>Things were as Mr. Hampton had described and,
after bedding down the camels at the rear, and rearranging
the screen of bushes where they had
entered in order to hide signs of their passage, all
lay down to snatch a few hours&rsquo; sleep except the two
guards. Jack and Frank begged so hard to be given
the task of keeping guard that Mr. Hampton, knowing
their anxiety regarding Bob, gave his consent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>Two hours later came daylight without an alarm
having been sounded. Then the two boys reluctantly
summoned Ali and another Arab, as had been
arranged, and rolling up in their burnooses flung
themselves on the grass. They were firmly convinced
that sleep would be impossible but nature
had her way with their overwrought systems, and
they sank fathoms deep in slumber. It was well
past noon before Mr. Hampton aroused them, and
their looks of astonishment at discovering they had
yielded to sleep were so comical that he chuckled
with silent laughter.</p>
<p>Before they could speak he laid a finger on his
lips, enjoining silence, and then in a low voice added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t seen anybody nor heard a sound.
But it is well to be careful. So keep your voices
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While they breakfasted, Mr. Hampton sat beside
the boys, and a sudden thought came to Jack which
caused him to jump up excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Dad,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got the Professor&rsquo;s
radio apparatus with us. Frank put it in
good shape. Now, it just occurred to me that when
Bob left the oasis with me to go on that disastrous
ostrich hunt he had a receiving set&mdash;our little pet
set&mdash;tucked away with him. The instruments were
in his helmet. The phones and the wire for antenna
and ground, were on his saddle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds crazy, I know, but it&rsquo;s just possible
that he may have managed to persuade his captors
to let him fiddle with the contraption. They
wouldn&rsquo;t know what it was for, and they might let
him amuse himself with it. Why not set up the
sending apparatus, and try to send him a message.
It&rsquo;s just a chance, I know. But still, if we should
manage to let the old boy know we were waiting
to rescue him, it would cheer him up, and it would
put him on his guard, too, so that he could look out
for himself when the attack comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton, thus appealed to, was tempted to
smile tolerantly. It seemed to him, indeed, crazy
to believe Bob would be able to receive a message.
Yet he was too kind-hearted to hurt the feelings of
his son and of Frank, who also hung on his decision.
Their anxiety about Bob was known to him. In
fact, he shared it. To be doing something, anything,
would help relieve the tension on their nerves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Jack,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;go ahead and try it.
Can&rsquo;t do any harm, and if you do manage to reach
Bob, even though he can&rsquo;t let you know you succeeded,
you certainly will be of comfort to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he thought of Bob&rsquo;s predicament, of the
mental torture the poor fellow must be undergoing,
Mr. Hampton was filled with despair. He turned
away to keep the boys from reading his thoughts in
his face.</p>
<p>Jack, however, was very close to his father in
spirit. Many a time, he showed an uncanny ability
at reading his thoughts. As Mr. Hampton strode
abruptly away, he turned to Frank and whispered:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dad&rsquo;s in the dumps. He doesn&rsquo;t really believe
we can rescue Bob. I can tell, all right. But, somehow,
I have a different feeling myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frank nodded soberly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see how your father feels, too,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite share your optimism. Things look
pretty black to me. After all, you must remember,
that fellow Amrath told your father there was another
way beside this to pass through the mountains
to Athensi. Bob&rsquo;s captors may have learned about
the exiles having repaired it, and may take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said Jack, thoughtfully, &ldquo;what
measures Father has taken to keep watch for the
approach of Bob and his captors. Think I&rsquo;ll ask
him,&rdquo; he added, rising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; said Frank, draining the last of his
coffee. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be getting to work on the radio in the
meantime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently Jack returned with word that one of
the Arabs had been out to the mouth of the pass
where, posted with glasses, he could maintain a
sharp lookout over the desert, while another had
been sent scouting up the Great Road toward
Korakum.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>&ldquo;I had a look at that road, Frank,&rdquo; added Jack.
&ldquo;Believe me, it is a wonder. It is composed of
great slabs of quarried rock two or three yards
square. The road is all eighty feet wide, Dad
estimates. And the ruts! Man alive, you ought to
see them, not deep, but innumerable, from the passing
of chariots in the ancient days Dad believes.
He says that at one time, undoubtedly, the road led
out into the desert, perhaps clear to Egypt. But of
course the shifting sand has covered it deep by
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hand me that coil of No. 14 wire, will you?&rdquo;
asked Frank, absorbed in the business of connecting
up his motor with the double-pole switch. &ldquo;There,&rdquo;
as he leaned back, to contemplate his work with
satisfaction, before resuming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you thought, Jack,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;of how
fascinating it is to camp beside this Great Road?
Think of the history it has made. History so
ancient there is no record of it left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, there is a record,&rdquo; corrected Jack.
&ldquo;Wait till we start deciphering the papyrus rolls in
the library of Athensi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;ll wait a long time for that,&rdquo; commented
Frank, completing the connection between
one pole of the switch with a post of the primary
coil of the alternating power transformer. &ldquo;A long
time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pessimist,&rdquo; said Jack, stooping down and connecting
the other post of the primary coil with one
of the posts of the key, then connecting the other
pole of the key with the second pole of the switch.
&ldquo;Pessimist,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got a bad day,
that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; said Frank, with conviction. &ldquo;Wish I
could feel as optimistic as you. But it strikes me
poor Bob is in one fix, and we stand a poor chance
of rescuing him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV.
<br /><span class="small">MEETING THE REVOLUTIONISTS.</span></h2>
<p>While the boys continued their operations, they
talked continually in lowered tones over the possibilities
of the situation. No matter what turn the
adventure should take, they were firmly determined
not to leave the desert alive without Bob. Each
felt in his heart that he would never dare face life if
he deserted their comrade in his hour of peril.
Despite his more buoyant spirits, Jack realized the
difficulties of effecting a rescue should Bob ever get
inside Athensi as well as did Frank.</p>
<p>Presently they became silent, to some extent by
reason of absorption in their work, but also because
their thoughts had strayed elsewhere. Frank in
spirit was back at their peaceful home on the far
end of Long Island. He could see the great house
of the Temples, homey and comfortable, among the
spreading elms and maples. He could see the tennis
court where so often he had performed, and flying
over it was a familiar figure in short white skirt,
hair bound back with a bandeau, vigorously wielding
the racquet against an unseen opponent. Della.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>It would be tough to pass out without seeing her
again. But tougher still to have to go home and
acknowledge that he had let her brother be captured
and carried away to certain death without
having done his utmost, even to life itself, to rescue
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t come back, old scout,&rdquo; he muttered,
soundlessly, &ldquo;maybe word of it will get to you some
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;quit talking to yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frank looked up guiltily. &ldquo;Did&mdash;did&mdash;you hear
what I said?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jack. Then he regarded him fixedly.
&ldquo;Della&rsquo;s the real stuff, Frank,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
worth everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frank dropped his eyes, but reached out to
squeeze Jack&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton slid into position beside them. His
approach had been soundless. He appeared worried,
and laid a finger on his lips to enjoin silence and, as
Jack half rose, pulled him down beside him. Then
motioning Frank to draw near, he whispered the
startling information that a troop of horsemen was
approaching along the Great Road from the direction
of Korakum.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;The scout sent up the Great Road brought back
the information several minutes ago,&rdquo; he whispered,
&ldquo;and as he said the horsemen still were some distance
off, I sent him down the pass to bring in the
man stationed there, who, otherwise, would have
been cut off. Both have just returned. I suppose
you fellows were too busy to notice what was going
on. Get your rifles and come along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without further words, he turned and walking
bent over made his way back toward the front of
the plateau where Ali and his Arabs awaited. The
boys, with beating hearts, seized their rifles and
followed.</p>
<p>What did this portend? Was the band of horsemen
coming to attack them? Had they been discovered?
Or were the Athensians riding out to meet
and escort back the raiders? Either contingency
spelled disaster to their project for Bob&rsquo;s rescue.
Frank and Jack felt their hearts sink.</p>
<p>The front of the plateau, at the edge of a terrace
sloping ten feet down to the road, was narrow.
Their force of ten was sufficient to defend it, as Mr.
Hampton had said, against an army. Lying down,
a yard or two apart, they were able to cover it
completely. Moreover, the thick underbrush afforded
an effective screen against detection. Unless it were
known they were there, or unless their presence was
betrayed by some noise made by the camels, they
could lie securely hidden.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>Little time for speculation was afforded. Barely
had the boys crept into the holes left for them in
the center of the line, between Mr. Hampton and
Ali, when the ringing sound of horses&rsquo; hoofs,
echoing between high walls, announced the near
approach of a considerable body of horsemen.</p>
<p>Then around the next bend above them came the
leaders of the troop, riding four abreast, with loose
rein, and followed by rank on rank, until a full
hundred men appeared. In the lead rode the
captain on a splendid black horse, not large, but
beautifully built, a perfect thoroughbred. This
captain was a young man, still in his thirties, beardless,
bronzed, with the same hawklike nose of
Amrath. The men in rank were some young, some
middle-aged, and their appearance was startling.
No two were dressed alike, although some form of
the knee-length toga was worn by all. Some wore
leggings, others rode bare-legged. Some wore
remarkable helmets, not on their heads, but dangling
at saddle bow, helmets of curious and exquisite
workmanship. Some wore shirts of mail, of very
fine links. One or two wore steel corslets. For
arms, all carried long bows, quivers of arrows
slung across their backs, short heavy swords by
their sides like those carried by the ancient Roman
centurions, and heavy spears. Perhaps a third also
carried rifles.</p>
<p>Rank on rank this troop rode past the plateau
without conversation in the ranks, each man sitting
easily in the saddle, grim faced or thoughtful. On
every face was a look of fine intelligence, and quite
evidently the force was composed of superior men.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>Jack and Frank were in a daze, lying with eyes
glued to the strange sight, unable to puzzle out the
meaning. Was this a troop of Athensian cavalry?
Then why the ragged dress of the riders? As for
Mr. Hampton, he, too, wondered, recalling that
Amrath had said the common people of Athensi
were steeped in ignorance. So, too, would be the
Janissaries of the priest clan. Yet these men,
stern and grim-faced all, looking like fighters, yet
also had an appearance of great intelligence which
he could not reconcile with his preconceived opinion
of what the soldiers would be like.</p>
<p>Bathed in the sunlight which fell into the canyon
from almost directly overhead, so that the windless
air was close and languid, the troop passed quickly,
and the last rank came in sight. Only three men
rode in it, and as they came abreast of Mr. Hampton
one of this number, a fine looking young fellow of
medium height, with crisp curling hair lying damp
on his bared forehead, turned in the saddle and
called to the fourth man some distance in the rear:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jepthah, close up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton&rsquo;s heart seemed to turn over in his
breast. As for Jack and Frank and Ali, to whom
he had repeated his conversation with Amrath,
they, too, recognized the name of one of the exiles
of Korakum described as &ldquo;true men.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;Coming, Amonasis, coming,&rdquo; called a voice
merrily, and the man addressed as Jepthah came in
sight. &ldquo;A stone in his hoof,&rdquo; he said patting the
neck of his horse.</p>
<p>Again the repetition of a proper name caught the
ears of his listeners. Amonasis. Another of those
true men of Amrath&rsquo;s tale. Only to Mr. Hampton,
with his partial knowledge of Athensian, was the
import of the conversation between Jepthah and
Amonasis understandable, however.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us halt a moment and await him,&rdquo; said
Amonasis to his two comrades, and they nodded.</p>
<p>All drew their horses toward the grassy terrace
of the plateau, and the animals, dropping their
heads, begun to nibble the grass. Not six feet
from the screen of bushes behind which lay Mr.
Hampton, to whom they were nearest, were they.
An illuminating idea which had been struggling for
birth in his mind from the first sight of the horsemen
burst into full being. These were not Athensian
Janissaries. On the contrary, they were
revolutionaries exiled to Korakum. Simultaneously
with the thought came the decision to speak to
them, and Mr. Hampton called cautiously in the
Athensian tongue:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move, Amonasis. Our rifles cover you.
See.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He poked the barrel of his rifle through the
screen of bushes almost into the face of the stupefied
man who he addressed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>&ldquo;Call Jepthah,&rdquo; Mr. Hampton continued. &ldquo;I
have word for you two and for a third man, Shilluk,
from your friend Amrath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Shilluk,&rdquo; spoke up another of the three,
while Amonasis beckoned Jepthah to approach and
rapidly repeated what Mr. Hampton had said,
&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; added Shilluk, &ldquo;this is my brother,
Shedrach&rdquo;&mdash;pointing to the fourth. &ldquo;We be all true
men. What sayeth Amrath?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come forth that we may see you,&rdquo; said
Amonasis. &ldquo;Be not afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of the others who have gone before?&rdquo;
asked Mr. Hampton, with difficulty mastering all
this Athensian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They be true men, too,&rdquo; said Jepthah, in a tone
of satisfaction. &ldquo;Amrath should have been with
us these last two days. There was a great hunting
out of spies and informers in Korakum. Now all
are hanged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these words, Mr. Hampton arose and stepped
forth, at the same time beckoning his companions
to do likewise. Deepest astonishment was visible
on the faces of the four Athensians at this unexpected
sight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who among you speaks French, Spanish or
English?&rdquo; Mr. Hampton asked. &ldquo;Or Arabic,
either?&rdquo; he added, thinking of Ali. If Amrath had
spoken truly in saying the revolutionaries all were
young men of the priest clan who had been sent
abroad in the world to study among various civilized
peoples, it was possible that one of the four was
capable of conducting the necessary conversation
in a language more familiar to Mr. Hampton than
Athensian.</p>
<p>Jepthah smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are an Englishman?&rdquo; he asked, in English
with only a trace of accent. &ldquo;I have served in the
Egyptian armies of England and know the language,
perhaps a trifle better than you, sir&rdquo;&mdash;with a
deprecatory bow&mdash;&ldquo;know our native tongue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not English,&rdquo; said Mr. Hampton smiling, &ldquo;but
American. However, our tongue is the same and
I&rsquo;m mighty glad to meet a man who can speak it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jepthah bowed. Politeness among these men
seemed unfailing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are a friend of Amrath,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we
can speak plainly. We are on an important mission
and must not delay. What message does he send, and
where is he? We feared he had been done away
with.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>&ldquo;He was attacked by Athensian soldiers,&rdquo; said
Mr. Hampton, coming at once to the point, &ldquo;and
left for dead at a desert oasis six days journey
distant to the north. We found him and nursed
him back to life. He was still weak and could not
move, but was out of danger, when we left him
a week ago. His message to you was that you
should help us. My son,&rdquo; he added simply, &ldquo;has
been captured by Athensian raiders, and from what
Amrath told us we fear he is destined to take part
in the Sacrificial Games. We are here to attempt
his rescue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jepthah looked along the line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten men to assail Athensi,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You are
very brave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton flushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We love him,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He is a great athlete
and undoubtedly has been captured for the Games.
At Amrath&rsquo;s direction we came directly to this point
in order to arrive in advance of my son&rsquo;s captors
who, said Amrath, would take a circuitous course
in order to touch at three water holes. My son&rsquo;s
captors were only eight or ten in number, we believe.
And we feel certain we have arrived ahead
of them. Here we lay in ambush since before dawn,
when by chance as you passed I heard repeated the
names of those true men Amrath told me to seek in
Korakum, and so appealed to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the course of this recital, Jepthah&rsquo;s face
betrayed increasing excitement, and barely had Mr.
Hampton concluded than the young Athensian
turned to his companions and began translating in
their own language at a rate far too rapid for Mr.
Hampton to follow.</p>
<p>Immediately Shedrach and Shilluk whirled their
horses and started down the Great Road at a breakneck
pace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>&ldquo;They go to tell our captain, Amanassar, what
you have said,&rdquo; explained Jepthah, again falling into
English and addressing Mr. Hampton. &ldquo;If the
troop has not yet debouched into the desert, he
will turn back and in the pass will await your son&rsquo;s
captors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if the troop did get into the desert, and
happened to be seen by the raiders,&rdquo; asked Jack,
anxiously. &ldquo;Would the fellows who hold Bob
prisoner realize your people are enemies and flee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; said Jepthah. &ldquo;Revolution has
been brewing for long, but this is our first open
move. Yesterday we hung all spies and informers
among us. Athensi is unapproachable by this direction
except through a subterranean river, which is
heavily guarded. Today we are on our way to
approach the city through the mountains by another
entrance over the Mountain Wall. We plan to
raise the standard of revolt against the priests and
their Janissaries, among the peasants and country
people.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><span class="small">REVOLT OF THE EXILES.</span></h2>
<p>The noonday heat was oppressive in the open,
and the faces of the two Athensians glistened with
perspiration as they sat their horses in the sun. Mr.
Hampton noting this, suggested they enter the shade
of the grove on the plateau pending the return of
their comrades, and Amonasis and Jepthah willingly
spurred their horses up the sloping terrace. Eager
to be of service, Jack hastened to the rear of the
plateau, returning presently with a bucket of clear
cold spring water which proved very refreshing to
the travellers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You found an admirable place for an ambush,&rdquo;
remarked Jepthah, looking about approvingly. &ldquo;I
have not been here before. Korakum is a considerable
distance up the Great Road, and we seldom
have come down here as it was unnecessary, we
thought, to keep watch on the desert. Only as we
passed through, in order to gain the other trail and
labor on repairing it, have we gone up and down.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then you did not know of the passage of the
raiding party?&rdquo; asked Jack, surprised. &ldquo;Does that
mean they left Athensi over the other road of which
you speak?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; confessed Jepthah, frankly. &ldquo;We
have been questioning ourselves as to whether the
spies among our number betrayed our work on that
trail to the authorities. The men who captured
your friend may have gone into the Great Desert
over that trail. Again, however, they may have
passed down this road without our being aware of
it. As you may see for yourselves some day, the
valley in which Korakum lies is of great extent, and
the ruined city where we dwell lies some distance
from the subterranean river by which men are accustomed
to come and go from Athensi. This party
may have passed to the outside quite easily without
being seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been living long at Korakum?&rdquo; asked
Mr. Hampton. &ldquo;Your friend, Amrath,&rdquo; he explained,
&ldquo;told me that in retaliation for sheltering
and speeding the departure of my friend, Professor
Souchard, a number of years ago, the kindly
exiles of Korakum were slain by the Athensian
authorities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jepthah threw up his hands in a gesture of anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That happened before our arrival, before the
arrival of any of us in this band,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Every
year a new levy of youth of the priest clan is sent
into the world to gain knowledge. Each man is
bound by the most solemn of oaths not to betray
knowledge of his country and to return on a certain day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard the story of your friend, and of
the exiles who were punished with death for permitting
his escape. It was horrible. I and my
friends were among those who returned home since
that occurrence, and because of our criticism of the
practises of our people, we were exiled to Korakum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I saw some middle-aged men in the troop of
Captain Amanassar,&rdquo; protested Frank, taking a
voice in the discussion.</p>
<p>Jepthah turned toward him, as he answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true. They were men living quietly in
Athensi who rebelled at the slaughter of the exiles
who aided Professor Souchard. That act of barbarism
and ruthlessness completed their distaste for
life under the Oligarchs, and they fled to join us
younger men who were exiled as a disciplinary
measure. Ah,&rdquo; he said, bitterly, &ldquo;we have been
steeped in the traditions of our caste which reach
back into ages more remote than any recorded
history known to you. To break away from those
caste instincts and traditions is very difficult. But
we cannot stand the Oligarchs any longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you not invite outside aid?&rdquo; asked Jack,
who had listened with intense interest.</p>
<p>Jepthah shrugged, and his face darkened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>&ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;if you know the history
of Africa of today, you will realize why we have
not done so. Outside of our own country, the
existence of which is not even suspected by the
great mass of humanity, although a few savants
like Professor Souchard and a few adventurers and
slave traders have some knowledge of it, what
portions of all this vast continent retain their freedom
today? Egypt? Morocco? Algiers? Tunis?
Tripoli? All ruled by interlopers. South Africa,
Central Africa, the West Coast, the East Coast, all
are subservient to one or other of the Powers. Only
Abyssinia of the ancient states retains its independence.
Liberia is a free country, too, but a republic
created by Negro slaves and supported by your
land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the tribes of the Great Desert,&rdquo; suggested
Ali, speaking for the first time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you Arab and Berber nomads know how
to retain your freedom,&rdquo; said Jepthah, tolerantly.
&ldquo;But if you dwelt in a rich and fertile land such as
lies within this vast ring of mountain, the conquerors
would not let you retain your independence.
Your desert protects your oases from their grasp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he added, after a moment&rsquo;s pause, &ldquo;we
have no desire to bring outsiders in to our aid, we
revolutionaries, knowing too well what that would
mean. You see&rdquo;&mdash;with a sad smile&mdash;&ldquo;we have only
recently returned from your own world, and our
opinion of the disinterestedness of your governments
is not the highest. No, we prefer to drive
out the Oligarchs ourselves and then&mdash;with a stable
government established, democratic and just, to invite
civilization to bring us its benefits and leave its
evils behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton nodded emphatic agreement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is, indeed, the wise thing to do,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;And now that we are on the scene, if we can be
of any help whatsoever, you have only to command
us. The cause in which you fight is, so far as I
can see, one worth enlisting to support. What you
have said interests me profoundly, and I would like
to talk with you and your friends more at length
about this mysterious land of yours. But, if I am
not mistaken, here come your friends returning, and
in haste, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clatter of rapid hoofbeats ascending the Great
Road from the direction of the desert was dear to
all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll wonder what has become of us,&rdquo; said
Jepthah. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give them a call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rising, he put one hand over his mouth and
emitted a peculiar call, obviously an understood
signal, for immediately the sound of hoofbeats
ceased as the horses came abreast of the plateau.
Then the screen of bushes parted and Shilluk and
Shedrach pushed their way into the grassy enclosure
toward the rear to which the party had
retired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>A rapid conversation between Shilluk and
Jepthah, carried on in Athensian, followed. Turning
to Mr. Hampton, Jepthah betrayed an anxious face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not seek to hide your son&rsquo;s danger from
you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Shilluk reports that before he could
reach Captain Amanassar the latter had sighted a
party of horsemen in the distance, apparently heading
for the other entrance through the Great
Mountain Wall. He set out in pursuit at once with
a score of our number comprising the best mounted,
leaving the others to follow more at leisure. This
Shilluk learned from the main body, which already
proceeded a short distance into the desert, but which
he overtook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Bob&mdash;&rdquo; began Mr. Hampton, when Jepthah
interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, sir, how you must feel,&rdquo; he said, sympathetically.
&ldquo;Yet Captain Amanassar will do his
utmost to aid, just as if he knew the circumstances
of your son&rsquo;s captivity. You see, from the main
body Shilluk gathered that Captain Amanassar
believed our troop had been sighted, and that it was
on that account the raiders headed for the other
road. He recognized them as of the Janissaries,
and will do his utmost to cut them off to prevent
word of our approach reaching Athensi. Not but
what the Oligarchs, whose spies riddle the country,
will hear soon enough,&rdquo; he concluded bitterly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hampton, you&rsquo;ve just got to let us go at
once,&rdquo; broke in Frank. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go crazy if I don&rsquo;t
have a hand in this. Poor old Bob.&rdquo; He was unable
to continue because of a lump that rose in his throat.</p>
<p>The elder man&rsquo;s hand dropped on his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo; he asked Jepthah. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t
your friends be surprised if these young fellows
come dashing along on camels?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are willing,&rdquo; said Jepthah, &ldquo;you shall all
come. Shilluk and Shedrach already have prepared
some of our comrades for sight of your party, and
they will have spread the word. All will be eager to
have your aid, and equally eager to aid your son if
possible. We heartily detest the holding of the
Sacrificial Games, which is a part of the detestable
religious practices kept alive by the Oligarchs. Come,
then, at once. Leave your equipment here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick, Jack,&rdquo; cried Frank.</p>
<p>His comrade nodded. They were first of the
troop to mount, and soon were flying down the
Great Road with the four Athensians, their camels
moving at a pace that astonished the horsemen. Not
far behind them came Mr. Hampton, Ali and the
Arabs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><span class="small">THE FIGHT FOR THE PASS.</span></h2>
<p>When they emerged from the Great Road, the
Great Desert lay shimmering before them. Under
the sun, standing directly overhead in a cloudless
sky, the irregular floor of sand stretching illimitably
in three directions like gently-rolling waves of the
sea arrested in motion, seemed radiating heat waves
like the top of a stove.</p>
<p>In the fourth direction, at their backs, stretched
away on either hand the Great Mountain Wall. For
the first time by daylight they had a good look at
it, and involuntarily both Jack and Frank drew in
their breaths at the sight.</p>
<p>Steep, precipitous, verdureless, the mountains
rose in great masses of rock directly out of the sand,
just as the Pillars of Hercules, guarding the Strait
of Gibraltar, rise out of the sea at the northwestern
extremity of the African continent. The sand was
like a sea dashing vainly against these gigantic
masses of rock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>One mountain overlapped another, so that only
narrow, unscalable clefts broke the face of this
tremendous bulwark. Truly, it was a Mountain
Wall. Ahead this wall stretched to the horizon,
and, looking over their shoulders, the boys saw no
end in sight behind them. A full two thousand feet
towered the serrated summits, jagged and sawtoothed,
forming grotesque shapes that resembled
crumbling turrets and, in some instances, crouching
animals of gigantic proportions.</p>
<p>The previous evening, before the light failed, and
while they still were hours away, they had been able
to see that beyond this wall lay a tumbled mass of
mountain tops rising higher and higher to a lofty
summit far to the south, which Mr. Hampton had
estimated at 14,000 or 15,000 feet in height. Apparently,
then, the mountain country was of considerable
extent, with many interior valleys and
plateaus.</p>
<p>Somewhere behind that Mountain Wall and in
the heart of that great upland country lay mysterious
Athensi, while through the rich valley and plateaus
were scattered the dwellings of the peasants comprising
the last of a prehistoric white race whence
had sprung, if Professor Souchard was correct,
all mankind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>But to these reflections Jack and Frank, unable
because they rode close to the foot of the Mountain
Wall and could not see the peaks of the country
behind it, gave only passing reflection. Almost immediately
on debouching into the desert they had
discerned far in the distance a number of tiny
figures drawing away from them to the west. These
undoubtedly were the horsemen of the rear guard
of Captain Amanassar&rsquo;s rebel troop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Jack,&rdquo; yelled Frank, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll race you
for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack yelled agreement, and away went the two
boys, jouncing and bumping in the awkward camel
saddles, their animals eating up the ground, while
beside them galloped the four young Athensians.
The boys had all they could do to hold on, but once
or twice managed to steal a glance over their
shoulders which assured them Mr. Hampton, Ali and
the Arabs were close in the rear.</p>
<p>The Athensian revolutionaries ahead were riding
at a brisk pace and the distance between decreased
slowly. Yet steadily the boys overhauled them
until, at the end of a half hour, they were up with
the rear ranks. That term, however, is a misnomer,
as the revolutionaries had broken ranks and were
riding without formation.</p>
<p>Jepthah brought his horse alongside Frank&rsquo;s
camel as they drew near and, when the rearmost
revolutionaries turned to glance back inquiringly,
he called to them in their own tongue. They nodded,
and several waved their hands to the boys in airy
salute.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>&ldquo;Follow me. Let me take the lead,&rdquo; Jepthah
called in English to Frank and Jack. Then he and
Amonasis, putting their horses together, passed
through the loose ranks of the revolutionaries, with
Jack and Frank on their swaying camels close behind.
Shilluk and Shedrach, following a quick
interchange of words in Athensian with Jepthah,
fell back to await the approach of Mr. Hampton and
the Arabs.</p>
<p>As the boys rode headlong among the revolutionaries,
who parted to let them pass, many curious
glances were thrown at them. Several times
Jepthah or Amonasis called out in Athensian,
evidently spreading the announcement of their
identity, and frequent salutes were given. As for
Jack and Frank, however, they were too busy clinging
to their swaying camels to accord acknowledgment
in kind.</p>
<p>Once through the ranks of the revolutionaries, the
boys began glancing anxiously ahead to catch sight
of Captain Amanassar&rsquo;s troop and, perhaps, of the
Janissaries with Bob. But neither group was in
sight. Was it possible, they asked themselves, that
already the pursuit had drawn so far ahead as to
be lost to view? Or had the two parties already
entered the break in the Mountain Wall of which
they had heard so much?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>Frank could not stand the anxiety without attempting
to obtain an answer to these questions and
called to Jepthah. After repeated attempts, he
managed to obtain the latter&rsquo;s attention. Jepthah
who had drawn considerably ahead, pulled up his
horse until Frank came alongside. The latter
shouted his queries, and received a shake of the
head in reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not out of sight down the desert,&rdquo; cried Jepthah.
&ldquo;But into the old trail. Follow swiftly. We may
be needed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before he could spur his horse ahead, Frank
called another question:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean the Janissaries reached the pass
ahead of your men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice was filled with horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so,&rdquo; replied Jepthah, with a look of
sympathy. &ldquo;Come on. All is not lost yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaning forward until he lay on the neck of his
splendid horse, he whispered into its ear. The
animal already running swiftly seemed to leap
ahead, gaining on Amonasis flying along in the lead.</p>
<p>Jack had drawn close during this brief conversation
carried on in shouts, and had gathered the
import of Jepthah&rsquo;s remarks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Frank, come on,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Never
say die.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>Faster and faster under shouts and blows ran the
camels, and for a time the boys had all they could
do to retain their precarious seats. For a time
Jepthah set their course well out into the desert, in
order to avoid the jumbled mass of rocks and
boulders lying at the foot of the Mountain Wall.
But presently he headed again toward the great
bulwark and the boys, following him, saw ahead a
break appear in the wall.</p>
<p>Narrower than the pass through which ran the
Great Road, it seemed as their eyes pierced deeper
with each forward lurch of the camels that it was
choked with fallen boulders over which it would be
difficult to make their way. But even as this
thought entered their minds, and while yet they
were a matter of a hundred yards distant, with
Jepthah and Amonasis somewhat nearer, around the
nearest bend of this pass came a fleeing mass of
horsemen.</p>
<p>Down toward the desert leaped the horses, surefooted
as goats, over the mass of boulders and
debris. Involuntarily, Frank and Jack pulled up
their camels, whose great padded hoofs slid in the
sand as they braced their legs to come to a halt.
Then they saw Jepthah turn in his saddle and wave
wildly for them to approach, after which he and
Amonasis flung themselves forward, unlimbering
their rifles as they ran.</p>
<p>At the same time, from beyond the bend in the
pass, came the rattle of rifles, and this time three
horses with empty saddles and a fourth dragging
the body of a fallen man whose foot was caught in
the saddle and who bumped sickeningly over the
rocks, came down the rock-choked pass.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>In one illuminating flash the meaning of the situation
appeared to Jack. Shouting across the gap
separating him from Frank, racing beside him, he
called:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rebels followed &rsquo;em into the pass and were ambushed,
I&rsquo;ll bet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frank made no answer. His face was white.
Undoubtedly, he thought, Jack had read the situation
aright. Then what of Bob? Had he been killed in
the fighting? Or had his captors escaped with him
into the interior?</p>
<p>Another man and another tumbled down the
pass, his horse taking the rocks at a sickening pace,
until ten were gathered at the foot, where Jepthah
and Amonasis could be seen rallying them. Just
as Frank and Jack gained the group, one more
revolutionary turned the bend, from beyond which
the sound of firing had drawn closer, and came
down the pass. The boys gasped in mingled admiration
of his daring horsemanship and fear for him.</p>
<p>He sat loosely in his saddle, the reins lying on
his horse&rsquo;s neck, leaving the sagacious animal to
pick his own way over the rock-strewn course.
Half-turned about, he held rifle to shoulder. Not
thirty feet behind him another horseman suddenly
appeared rounding the sharp turn in the pass, and
the rifle of the revolutionary cracked and almost
simultaneously the other pitched from his saddle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>A cheer went up from those in the plain, and with
a wave of the hand in acknowledgment, the lone
revolutionary continued the descent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; asked Jack of Jepthah, beside whom
he had pulled up his camel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Amanassar on his wonder horse,
Sheelah,&rdquo; replied the other in a tone of pride. &ldquo;Here
they come. Give them a volley,&rdquo; he added, and
raising his voice shouted a similar command in
Athensian.</p>
<p>Only five of the Athensians carried rifles, and
none was a modern arm. They were long barrelled
Arab weapons. However, with these they shot over
the head of Captain Amanassar, while their comrades
loosed a flight of arrows, and Jack, Frank,
Jepthah and Amonasis also joined in. The repeaters
of the boys worked deadly execution, and the
head of a tumultuous mass of Athensian Janissaries
which, pushed forward apparently by the weight of
numbers in the rear, swept around the bend in the
pass on the heels of the fallen leader whom Captain
Amanassar had shot down, melted away. Men and
horses fell in a writhing heap on the narrow, rock-strewn
causeway, and effectually blocked the advance
of those behind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>Bewildering events succeeded almost too rapid,
in fact, for Jack and Frank to follow. Captain
Amanassar took charge of the situation, shouting
his orders in Athensian which the boys could not
understand. They saw him cast a surprised, frowning
glance at them, and turn to Jepthah who pushed
to his side and spoke rapidly. Then his eyes, which
had not been taken from them, lighted up with a
rare smile, and across the intervening horsemen,
Jack and Frank saw him lift his hand to his forehead
in a semi-formal salute.</p>
<p>After that, for a time, in the press of more urgent
matters, he paid them no attention. Mr. Hampton
with his Arabs arrived, and sharp on their heels
the vanguard of the main body of revolutionaries,
with the others continually spurring forward.
Rapidly the dimensions of the force at the foot of
the pass grew.</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton withdrew to one side with the boys
and his Arabs, and Jack and Frank in broken sentences
recounted what had occurred before his
arrival. All watched the disposition Captain Amanassar
was making of his forces, seeing groups of
horsemen detach themselves from the main body and
go whirling away to the westward along the Great
Mountain Wall, while those remaining dismounted
and handed over their horses to a small guard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must see about this,&rdquo; said Mr. Hampton. &ldquo;It
looks as if they planned to attempt to retake the
pass, probably attacking afoot directly while others
go to hunt paths up over the rocks which will permit
them to take the enemy in the rear. Perhaps we
can be of help. Let everybody await me here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>So saying he went forward toward Captain
Amanassar who, like the others, had dismounted,
and by whose side stood Jepthah. The boys saw
Mr. Hampton join the two Athensian revolutionaries
in conversation and, after a vigorous interchange
of words, turn and make his way back to
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is as I suspected,&rdquo; he reported. &ldquo;So I have
offered to take over the duty of looking after their
horses, which will permit all their forces to engage.
Also, we are going to lend our repeaters to the
revolutionaries, as Jepthah says there are a number
of men in the ranks familiar with their use. Here
they come now to receive them,&rdquo; he added, as
Jepthah advanced with two others to receive the
rifles of Mr. Hampton and the boys. &ldquo;So hand them
over, along with your ammunition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Mr. Hampton,&rdquo; protested Frank, &ldquo;I want
to have a hand. Think of old Bob.&rdquo; His voice
broke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said the older man, kindly. &ldquo;But the
pass must be forced if the revolutionaries are to gain
the interior. The raiders, they tell me, were met
here by a force of two score Athensian Janissaries,
who beat off Captain Amanassar&rsquo;s first attack. If
we are to be of any help to Bob, we must let these
men clear the way. And in doing that, you might
lose your life uselessly, if you were to take active
part in the attack. Come, now, hand over your
rifle.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>Reluctantly, Frank and Jack consented, after
which with the Arabs they went to relieve the horse
guard. Mr. Hampton, however, joined Captain
Amanassar, who stayed in the plain directing
operations.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII.
<br /><span class="small">A DARK HOUR.</span></h2>
<p>Much of the fight for possession of the gateway
to the pass was out of sight of the boys. For a
time, they could see the figures of the dismounted
revolutionaries creeping over the rocky road,
hugging the walls, until they reached the barrier
of fallen Janissaries and horses.</p>
<p>Across this barrier there flashed a continuous fire
of weapons for some time, with no advantage to
either side, so far as was apparent to those left in
the plain.</p>
<p>Then a new element entered the situation with a
distant sound of rifle fire, as the party of revolutionaries
who had been sent to the west came into
action at the rear of the Janissaries. These revolutionaries,
the boys later learned, had clambered like
goats up the face of the cliff and gained a position
on the rocky western wall of the pass, from which
they were enabled to assail the Janissaries in the
rear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>A sudden burst of cheering in the distance was
followed by the swarming of the revolutionaries in
the pass across the wall of dead and wounded. Man
after man disappeared without opposition, passing
across the fallen and vanishing into the pass beyond
the bend. Then for some time the sound of firing
continued, growing ever more distant, until it no
longer came back to those below.</p>
<p>Once more stillness descended in the hot desert
and the narrow pass, now lying in shadow as the
sun wheeled to the west and the steep western wall
of rock cut off its rays. Only the horses, the Arabs
on camel back circling slowly about them, Captain
Amanassar, Jepthah and Mr. Hampton, three tiny
figures afoot at the base of the pass, and the dead,
remained.</p>
<p>Eaten up with anxiety as to the fate of Bob, a
prisoner in the midst of the fighting so far as they
knew, the boys no longer could contain their impatience.
They saw a revolutionary return down
the pass, making his way over the barrier of men
and horses at the bend, picking a careful passage
over the rocks below, and moving to report to Captain
Amanassar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Jack, let&rsquo;s hear what he has to say,&rdquo;
begged Frank. &ldquo;I know your Dad told us to stay
here, but the Arabs can look after the horses and
I&rsquo;ll go crazy if I don&rsquo;t do something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack felt pretty nearly as cut up over the failure
to rescue Bob, as did his comrade, and nodded in
sympathy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go up and ask Dad
what the messenger reports. Hardly likely, though,
that he has any word of Bob.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they reached Mr. Hampton&rsquo;s side, the messenger
already had made his report. Jepthah, interpreting
the reason for their approach, turned to them
with a grave face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no sign of your comrade,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
asked the messenger particularly. He is not among
either the prisoners or the fallen. Some of the
Janissaries escaped, and evidently they have borne
him with them. They will make their way to
Athensi. We cannot stop them. They have broken
down a bridge which we recently rebuilt across a
deep chasm and for a time our advance is held up.
Athensi lies many miles away, however, and we
shall be able to gain the interior before fresh forces
can be thrown against us. The Sacrificial Games
still are more than a month away, and in the meantime
something can be done toward effecting a
rescue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this, Jepthah returned to Captain Amanassar&rsquo;s
side, while Mr. Hampton joined the boys.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>He reported that Captain Amanassar was going
forward to join the revolutionaries, a portion of
whom would be sent back to clear the pass so that
the horses could be taken into the mountains. Aware
now that betrayal of their plans by spies of the
Oligarchy in their ranks had been more general than
supposed, Captain Amanassar found it necessary to
re-arrange his campaign.</p>
<p>Originally, he had intended entirely to abandon
Korakum. Its peculiar position, in an outer valley,
leading only by the Great Road to the desert and by
the subterranean river to Athensi, made it a poor
basis of operations from which to conduct a revolution
among the countrymen of the many interior
valleys and plateaus against the central authority of
the Oligarchy. All this he and Jepthah had explained
to Mr. Hampton. By placing a guard over
the pass just captured, the revolutionaries would be
able to prevent any forces sent out from Athensi via
the river and Korakum from attacking them in the
rear.</p>
<p>A chance suggestion made by Mr. Hampton had
taken root. If the spies, as now was apparent, had
betrayed the revolutionists&rsquo; plans, then the Oligarchs
would not be looking for attack from Korakum
along the subterranean river. Therefore, Mr.
Hampton had suggested the possibility of making
such an attack at a later date in conjunction with an
attack in force from the field.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>&ldquo;They expect,&rdquo; he told the boys, &ldquo;to be able to
raise a considerable army of ten thousand or more
countrymen, for the country groans under the misrule
of the Oligarchs and is ripe for revolution. It
awaits only the coming of a leader supported by
determined captains, and in Captain Amanassar and
his hundred men I feel certain such leaders have
been found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly, it had been decided not to abandon
Korakum entirely, but to place a guard over the
subterranean river for the purpose of capturing any
Janissaries who might negotiate its passage from
the interior, and of retaining control of that underground
water thoroughfare to Athensi.</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton, the boys and the Arabs were to
form a portion of this guard, as Jack&rsquo;s father had
assured Captain Amanassar he would co-operate
with the revolutionaries, at least as long as there was
a possibility of effecting Bob&rsquo;s rescue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is pretty certain,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;that Bob was
captured to participate in the Sacrificial Games.
Such being the case, his life will be jealously guarded
until the time of the Games arrives. That gives us
a full month more. Certainly, some way of saving
him will develop in that time. Perhaps, the revolutionists
will be successful and then, of course, the
men destined to participate in the Games will be set
free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack and Frank could do nothing except acquiesce
gloomingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But think of Bob&rsquo;s feelings all that time, as he
sees the end draw nearer with no word of hope from
us,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; added Jack &ldquo;when he is in prison he
will be able to rig up his radio set and we can send
him a message of comfort, something to tell him we
are working to rescue him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; said Frank, sadly. &ldquo;But we wouldn&rsquo;t
know whether he got our message or not. Well,
come on. If it&rsquo;s back to Korakum, we&rsquo;ll finish
putting the radio apparatus in shape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Side by side, silent, each immersed in sad
thoughts, Jack and Frank led the way on the return,
followed by their companions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX.
<br /><span class="small">AT LOW EBB.</span></h2>
<p>Now began a period of waiting, during which
the boys saw little of Jepthah. A guard of ten
revolutionists was sent back to Korakum to supplement
their own force under command of a cheery
young man named Horeb who, like Jepthah, had
served in the British Sudanese army, and had a
good command of English. Thus the two parties
had a common medium of expression. From Horeb,
who each day sent a messenger to the main body,
they received fragmentary accounts of the progress
of events in the field.</p>
<p>Things were going well with the revolutionists,
they learned. The Janissaries, numbering 5,000, so
far had failed to take the field against them, for
what reason was not known. In the meantime, Captain
Amanassar was rallying the sturdy peasants of
the valleys and plateaus and the herders of the
mountains to his standard. He had advanced twenty
miles into the mountains in three days and already
a force of fifteen hundred men had assembled.
He lay at the village of Sharpath, on a high plateau,
well guarded against surprise, and intended to maintain
this position for a week or more while the countrymen
continued to come in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>Sharpath, the boys were told, stood in the center
of a broad plateau comprising one of the richest
agricultural districts of the mountain country and
the road approaching it from Athensi, along which
the Janissaries would have to move to attack, passed
through a deep gorge which already was in possession
of the revolutionists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right for them,&rdquo; muttered Frank. &ldquo;But the
longer they stay there, the nearer draws the day of
the Sacrificial Games. I&rsquo;m worried about Bob,
Jack, and I want to do something. Can&rsquo;t you put
your mind on it. I&rsquo;ve been thinking of ways and
means until I feel as if I were growing insane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frank was seated at the table on which the radio
sending apparatus had been set up in the little grove
off the Great Road where originally they had taken
shelter. When surprised by the revolutionists he
and Jack had left their work of putting the radio
into shape uncompleted. Since their return they
had been wandering over the ruins of Korakum for
two days without again thinking of the radio, lost
in admiration of this ancient city&mdash;the oldest, undoubtedly,
in the world.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>Only a few of the buildings had survived the
ravages of thousands of years, here a temple, there
a palace. They jutted up among the vegetable gardens
of the exiles, and, when the boys expressed to
Horeb their surprise at not finding even a trace of
other ruins, he shrugged and smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The houses of the common people were not
builded of enduring materials,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is so in
Athensi today. The common people live in mud
huts with wattled walls and thatched roofs, little
better than those of African savages. But the
temples and palaces of Athensi, ah!&rdquo; He made a
gesture indicative of his despair at attempting to
characterize them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some day soon, I hope, you shall see for yourselves,&rdquo;
he added. &ldquo;And it was so in Korakum.
These temples and palaces, as you can see, were
built of granite hewn from the mountains, and are
of immense solidity. Even they have fallen into
ruins now, as you see, for this city was founded a
full thousand years before the first of our people
entered Egypt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>&ldquo;We came from the great island continent of
Atlantis, lying west of the Pillars of Hercules, west
of the Strait of Gibraltar, and our city was the first
Atlantean colony. Our people pushed south along
the African coast, into the Gulf of Guinea, up the
Niger river, and thence eastward. Here was their
first permanent settlement, and Korakum was a
flourishing capital before we dreamed of entering
Egypt. History?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Wait until the world
receives the translations of the stories in the Library
of Athensi. It is the history of the world before the
Flood submerged Atlantis, giving rise to all the
legendary stories of the Flood which persist in the
literature of all people. It is the history of a mightier
civilization, extending farther back into the years,
than your wildest dreamers ever conjured out of
their imaginations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through echoing stone halls of vast breadth and
height, up stone stairways, under gaping roofs, for
two days, the boys had wandered at will, staring at
the shell of that ancient civilization of which Horeb
spoke, marvelling at the tremendous labor involved
in these buildings, involuntarily dropping their
voices to a whisper in the presence of the ghosts of
uncounted centuries.</p>
<p>But now, on the third day, having seen all there
was to see and not being scientists who could pore
forever over the meaning of faded and worn inscriptions
found here and there upon a fallen block of
stone, they were back in the grove, and Frank was
seated at the radio and voicing his desire for action,
immediate action, looking to the rescue of his chum.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>This apparatus, devised by the boys working in
conjunction in their home laboratories at the Temple
and Hampton country homes, adjoining each other,
on Long Island, was a duplex sending and receiving
station. In it they had departed from the accepted
methods of duplex operation, of which the best
known is that of Marconi, regulated by a receiver
coupled to the coils of a transmitting antenna and
a balancing antenna, by means of which one signal
may be cut out completely while another is retained
undiminished, thus insuring reception and transmission
simultaneously.</p>
<p>Instead, they had worked out a system whereby
the voice exercised full control. When speech was
not being used, the set was receptive to messages
from other points. But the moment one began to
speak, a sluggish contact device consisting of mercury
in capillary tube was closed by the vocal vibrations
and the set at once thrown into transmission.
This controlling device was located in the microphone
transmitter, and that it had escaped destruction
in the vandalism practised on the set by Professor
Souchard&rsquo;s murderers was little short of a
miracle.</p>
<p>After voicing his request that Jack put his mind
to work to evolve some plan for rescuing Bob,
Frank picked up the headphones and idly clasped
them to his ears, and sat silent, gloomily regarding
the instruments on the table, although in reality
not seeing them. By some chain of thought, he was
once more back on Long Island, standing on the
lawn of the Temple home, and watching for Della
to emerge from the doorway. It seemed to him, so
powerful was the impression, that he had arrived
to tell her Bob had been slain in the Sacrificial
Games in Athensi, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; he cried suddenly, in so startled and excited
a voice that his chum, sprawled on the grass,
leaped to his feet. &ldquo;My&mdash;my&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Words failed him, his face grew white as a sheet,
and his eyes seemed actually to bulge out of their
sockets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; demanded Jack, anxiously. &ldquo;Are
you sick? Speak. Tell me what&rsquo;s the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frank could only wave his hands feebly and shake
his head.</p>
<p>Then he seemed to change into new life under
Jack&rsquo;s gaze. Color returned to his cheeks, his eyes
grew bright and joyful, and, leaning forward, he
drew the telephone transmitter toward him and began
to speak. In Jack&rsquo;s mind, stupefaction succeeded
bewilderment as he listened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX.
<br /><span class="small">AN OLD FRIEND APPEARS.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hampton isn&rsquo;t here, but this is one of his
men speaking,&rdquo; Jack heard Frank say.</p>
<p>As in a daze, Jack stood open-mouthed while
Frank continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that? Roy Stone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frank&rsquo;s voice was joyful, unbelieving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s you, Stone. I just can&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
Frank continued. &ldquo;This is Frank Merrick speaking.
But how in the world? Where did you come
from? Wait a minute, wait a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Roy Stone,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Remember?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>Did Jack remember? A flood of memory engulfed
him. All the details of that fight in the cave a good
four years before came sweeping back. Mr. Hampton
had been held prisoner by Mexican rebels in a
stronghold in Old Sonora, across the border from
New Mexico. The rebels also had stolen the airplane
which was the pride of Bob and Frank, who
were its joint owners. Setting out with Tom Bodine,
an ex-cowboy, to rescue Jack&rsquo;s father, the three boys
had put up one night in a mountain cave to which
Tom led them.</p>
<p>They found it outfitted as a radio station by the
Mexican rebels. Shortly after their arrival, one
of the Mexicans named Morales, a German named
Von Arnheim, who was stirring up trouble on the
border in the hope of embroiling the United States
in war, and a young American aviator named Roy
Stone, a stormy petrel, a soldier of fortune, who
had cast in his lot with the rebels, arrived. More
to the point, they arrived in the airplane stolen from
the boys.</p>
<p>In the fight which followed in the dark cave, the
boys and Tom Bodine had won. The three others
had been made prisoners. Learning their story and
realizing the Mexican rebels were being employed
as pawns by Von Arnheim, to the detriment of his
own country, the American Stone had swung his
allegiance to the boys and had been of material aid
in effecting the subsequent rescue of Mr. Hampton.</p>
<p>All this came back to Jack in a flash, and he wondered
if he had heard Frank aright. How in the
world could Frank be speaking with Roy Stone?
Frank was listening in wrapt attention to whatever
message was coming over the radio, and Jack could
not bear the suspense. He grasped Frank by an arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you dreaming?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Tell me what
all this is about?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, Roy, wait a minute,&rdquo; Frank again
said, speaking into the telephone transmitter. &ldquo;Jack
Hampton is here and he thinks I&rsquo;m going crazy.&rdquo;
Then he turned to Jack with shining eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Roy Stone all right enough,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
flying for the Spanish government, which is having
one of its numerous wars with the Riff tribesmen of
Morocco. At least, he&rsquo;d been flying for the Spaniards
but decided to quit fighting the Moors who had a
better right to their own country than the Spaniards.
Now he is crossing the desert to Abyssinia, where
somebody told him there&rsquo;s a war he could have a
hand in. Anyway that&rsquo;s what I gather. He was
forced to descend at the Oasis Aiz-Or, and there
found Amrath who told him of us. He recognized
the names and wants to know if he can be of help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can be of help?&rdquo; shrieked Jack. Seizing the
transmitter he called into it:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, old scout. This is Jack Hampton. Come
a-flying. You&rsquo;ll be an angel from heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Releasing the transmitter, Jack darted away, calling
to Frank:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep him till I get back. I&rsquo;m going to round up
Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>Mr. Hampton was not in sight in the grove, and
Jack dashed out into the hot sunshine and up the
Great Road toward Korakum. Despite the oppressive
heat in the pass, he ran as if he had wings
on his heels. So great was his sense of elation at
finding an airplane and a friendly pilot near enough
to be of aid, though just how that aid could be employed
he had not yet decided, that he would have
been able to run all the way to Korakum without
feeling fatigue.</p>
<p>As matters turned out, however, that was unnecessary.
Before he had gone far, Jack saw Mr.
Hampton appear in sight on camel-back. He waved
an arm frantically for his father to hurry, and the
latter, alarmed, put his animal to a trot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened now?&rdquo; he called, as he drew
nearer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry along to the grove, Dad,&rdquo; panted Jack.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll follow as fast as I can. The radio&rsquo;s working
and we&rsquo;ve got an angel on the wireless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; demanded his father, &ldquo;have you gone
crazy? Out here in this sun without your helmet,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crazy, yes, Dad,&rdquo; Jack laughed merrily, &ldquo;crazy
with joy. Now do hurry along. Frank&rsquo;s got word
for you, and someone for you to talk with over the
radio who&rsquo;ll give you your best hour for many a
day. No, I&rsquo;m all right, really. Just go on to the
grove.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing that Jack was really serious, despite his
exuberance, Mr. Hampton wonderingly continued.
When Jack arrived later he found his father seated
at the phone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s talking to Amrath now,&rdquo; said Frank.
&ldquo;Hear him, speaking French.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>Drawing Jack to a sufficient distance so that their
conversation would not disturb Mr. Hampton, Frank
explained. Only a short time before, Roy Stone
had arrived at the oasis where, as Frank had earlier
told Jack, he was hospitably received by Amrath
who had recovered his strength in a considerable
measure. Learning he was an American, Amrath
had spoken of the other Americans who recently
stayed at the oasis. Then, as Stone recognized
Mr. Hampton&rsquo;s name, the whole story, even to the
kidnapping of Bob, and the setting out of the rescue
party, had been related to him.</p>
<p>At once he had gone to his airplane, which had
been forced to descend because of a leak in the
radiator, and had tuned up his radio and started
calling for Mr. Hampton on the slim chance that he
would be able to reach his old-time friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he hadn&rsquo;t heard from us,&rdquo; added Frank, &ldquo;he
intended to get directions from Amrath for finding
Korakum and fly south in search of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luckily, he did get us,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Think
Frank. With an airplane we may be able to work
out some plan of getting into Athensi and rescuing
Bob.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I am thinking of,&rdquo; said Frank.
&ldquo;And what I was thinking of all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad has finished talking to Amrath, I reckon,&rdquo;
Jack pointed out. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hear what he has to say.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>They made their way to the side of Mr. Hampton
who, having taken the headphones from his ears, sat
with his head bowed into his hands.</p>
<p>Jack laid a hand on his father&rsquo;s shoulder, and the
older man lifted a face unashamedly wet with tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;why&mdash;&rdquo; began Jack, startled.</p>
<p>His father smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Jack,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Only I have been
so worried about Bob. And this sudden discovery
of Roy Stone in this part of the world, and with an
airplane, seems like an answer to prayer. If there
is any way of saving Bob, I begin to believe it must
be by airplane, because the campaign of the revolutionists
will take too long. Athensi may fall in time,
but the Sacrificial Games would be held long before
the city&rsquo;s capitulation. And that would mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know Dad.&rdquo; Jack&rsquo;s hand gripped his father&rsquo;s
shoulder hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, things look immeasurably brighter now,&rdquo;
Mr. Hampton added. &ldquo;And for the revolutionists,
too. Stone is a quixotic fellow or he would not have
left the Spanish service because he thought the
Moors were receiving a bad deal. It may be, he will
be glad to help the revolutionists. And an airplane
could certainly be of use to them. But, first of all,
he said he would do his best to help rescue Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be here at sunset. The oasis is three
hundred miles away, but what it took us six days
to travel, Stone can cover in three hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Amrath is sufficiently recovered to come,
too. Now I must go and tell Horeb. He&rsquo;ll be glad.
Amrath is a big man among these revolutionists.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XXI.
<br /><span class="small">REUNION.</span></h2>
<p>When Roy Stone, having repaired the leak in his
radiator, descended in a long spiral, bringing his
airplane to rest on the desert not far from the mouth
of the Great Road, he found as strange a reception
committee awaiting him as ever greeted an aviator&rsquo;s
landing.</p>
<p>It was near the hour of sunset. The last rays of
the descending sun, balanced on the edge of the
world and about to sink below the horizon, shot almost
straight across the desert. Low sand dunes of so
little height as to seem almost invisible at noon, now
shot lengthy grotesque shadows to the east. The
face of the Great Mountain Wall, solid unbroken
gray rock, glowed in a misty golden light. The far
peaks of the interior country, rising from pools of
purple shadow, seemed like lighted cones. The
shadows of those standing grouped on the desert
floor and waving hands and burnooses in greeting,
wavered to extraordinary length to the eastward
along the desert floor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>In that group were the majority of the dozen
revolutionists of the Korakum guard, only four
having been left to patrol the spot where the river
broke through the interior mountains to run swift
and wide around the valley of Korakum. Bare-legged,
togaed, they alone made a sufficiently strange
effect. But added to their number were Ali and
four of the Arabs. Akmet having been left to aid
the Korakum guards, and they were dressed in their
flowing burnooses while beneath their turbans appeared
swarthy faces, hook-nosed and bearded. To
cap all, were Mr. Hampton, Jack and Frank, who
had discarded burnooses in favor of soft tan shirts,
khaki pants and sandals. They still wore their sun
helmets.</p>
<p>Descending in a long spiral, the airplane&mdash;a four-passenger
bomber type&mdash;struck the sand lightly,
skimmed lightly across a sand dune and came to rest
on a smooth hard floor of sand.</p>
<p>From it stepped first Roy Stone, tearing leather
helmet and goggles from him and exposing a tanned
face beaming at the greetings of the boys who were
approaching at a tearing run, and then Amrath
whom Stone assisted to alight. At sight of the
latter Horeb who followed the boys let out a shout
of joy, and the next moment the two revolutionists
were clasped in each other&rsquo;s arms, while their
countrymen flocked about them, and from the mass
came a confused clatter of Athensian language for
all the world like an ignited pack of firecrackers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to &rsquo;em hit their bloomin&rsquo; language on the
nose,&rdquo; ejaculated Roy Stone, grinning. &ldquo;Well, me
lads,&rdquo; he added, pumping away vigorously, for Jack
and Frank each had seized a hand, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tickled to
death to see you, but if you let go a paw for a
minute I&rsquo;d like to shake Mr. Hampton&rsquo;s hand, too.
If you don&rsquo;t mind, y&rsquo; know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereat the boys released his hands and proceeded
to thump him enthusiastically on the back, a
procedure which Stone answered by whirling quick
as a cat, and with a stoop and a sudden twist catching
both by the legs and dumping them unceremoniously
on the sand. A burst of laughter came from
the Arabs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glory be that you arrived,&rdquo; said Mr. Hampton,
as he clasped the aviator&rsquo;s hand and looked deep
into his steady gray eyes. &ldquo;For one thing,&rdquo; he
added, in an undertone, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve already done them
good. What they both need is a little play. They&rsquo;re
breaking their hearts over Bob&rsquo;s predicament, and
that trick you just played on them has made them
laugh for the first time in many days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone nodded understandingly and then, as the
boys having risen to their feet joined him, still
laughing, he said in a calm matter-of-fact tone:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>&ldquo;No need to worry about Bob, any more. We&rsquo;ll
snake him out of any old mountain city in a matter
of minutes. The old buss can go anywhere, and if
you lads and Uncle Roy can&rsquo;t turn a simple trick
like that, why, by golly, we ought to be sent back to
school. How about it?&rdquo; he concluded challengingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; said Jack, catching Stone&rsquo;s spirit of
optimism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No question about it now,&rdquo; Frank firmly
declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the spirit,&rdquo; approved Stone. &ldquo;Well, give
me a couple of trusty men to place on guard over
the old buss so that nobody gets curious and steals
the engine or something, and then lead me to a bite
to eat. I could sink a tooth in some food without
a qualm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve thought of the matter of guards,&rdquo; said
Mr. Hampton. &ldquo;These Athensian revolutionists
and the Arabs all have seen airplanes before, the
Athensians having served in the various Spanish
and French Foreign Legions of Northern Africa or
the British Sudanese forces. So none is scared of
it. Lieutenant Horeb has promised to put two men
on guard, and I think we can safely leave it to their
charge. Yes, as you see&rdquo;&mdash;he added, pointing&mdash;&ldquo;two
men already have taken up their posts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then, come on,&rdquo; said Stone nodding.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve taken the keys, and nobody can fly away with
her. And out here on the desert, it&rsquo;s hardly likely
there will be visitors, so lead on. I&rsquo;m a starving
man.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>Amrath approached to greet Mr. Hampton, whom
he thanked again very earnestly for having saved
his life, and to be introduced to the boys. His deep
eyes glowed as he clasped the older man by the
hand, and promised his compatriots would spare no
effort to rescue Bob from Athensi. Then he departed
with Horeb and the other revolutionists, while the
Hampton party with Roy Stone in the center, fell
in behind, for the walk up the Great Road to
Korakum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the same,&rdquo; said Mr. Hampton, as Amrath
passed beyond earshot, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m banking more on your
efforts to save Bob by means of the airplane, Stone,
than on those of the revolutionists. Their leader is
proceeding cautiously, so as to rally the whole
country around him before he moves up to attack
the walls of Athensi. Unless he executes a coup,
gains possession of the city by a trick, it will take
months to bring about its fall. Of course, he may
not be successful at that, as the Oligarchy has a
powerful trained army of 5,000. No, it&rsquo;s the airplane
that must be our salvation, or, rather, Bob&rsquo;s,
for it is quite possible the Sacrificial Games in
Athensi may come and go before the rebels succeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>&ldquo;This fellow Amrath has been explaining the
situation to me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;so I know what you&rsquo;re
talking about. And I&rsquo;m inclined to agree with you.
But I feel confident we can snake Bob out in the airplane.
Amrath has given me a minute description
of the situation of Athensi and of the location of
the gladiators&rsquo; training camp, so to speak. He&rsquo;s
even drawn me a kind of a rude map which I&rsquo;ll
show you later. It&rsquo;ll be touch and go, quite likely,
but we&rsquo;ll do it all right. I&rsquo;ve got an ace in the
hole which I&rsquo;ll tell you about later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton dropped a hand on the aviator&rsquo;s
shoulder and pressed hard.</p>
<p>That night in Korakum there was a feast and
merrymaking. Horeb had sent word to Captain
Amanassar of the expected arrival of their comrade
Amrath and of a friendly aviator with an airplane
which he would place at their service, after first
attempting the rescue of the young American captive
from Athensi. This word he had sent as soon
as learning from Mr. Hampton of the message the
boys had received by radio. Captain Amanassar
would not be able to come to Korakum, but Jepthah
who commanded at the entrance to the other pass,
appeared as the feasting began, and an affecting
scene occurred on his reunion with Amrath.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>Goats were killed, a skin of native wine was produced
by the revolutionists, there was a profusion
of vegetables from their garden plots, and the
mingled Athensians and Arabs made merry, Mr.
Hampton, the two boys and Roy Stone, sitting at
one side of the great fire, in the light of which stood
out not only the startling faces of Athensians and
Arabs but also the many-pillared front of an ancient
temple at their backs, looked on in delight at the
scene. They were talking over plans for the rescue
of Bob, and examining the map of Athensi drawn
by Amrath. But even in the absorption of this
pursuit, one or other would now and again lift his
eyes to gaze in artistic appreciation at the strange
sight.</p>
<p>Finally, even the map was put away, and the four
turned all their attention to their surroundings, for
Akmet had been persuaded by his fellows to tell
a story and, once he began, although his language
was understood only by his fellows, the Athensians
and the Americans alike fell under the magic of his
spell.</p>
<p>Many times before, at night encampments, Mr.
Hampton and the boys had heard Akmet recite
stories. For, among Arabs, Moors, Berbers, and
the Negroes of the Sahara, the poet and the story-teller
are held in high esteem. And, although none
of his American auditors could understand a word
of the Arabic, yet he had the gift of portraying
by tone and gesture the very spirit of the words.</p>
<p>At such times the three, with their sensitive imaginations,
had been stirred deeply. As for the Arabs,
Akmet never failed to hold them spellbound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a treat in store,&rdquo; Mr. Hampton
whispered to Stone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>But tonight Akmet was not the story-teller, but
the composer of verses. From a fold of his burnoose
he drew out a beautifully worked small lute
upon which he struck with an eagle quill. For a
moment or two he thrummed idly, without tune,
seeking a chord that appealed to him. At the same
time he stared all around the group which had
drawn closer about him, looking through vacant
eyes at each in turn. There was a pause, during
which Ali drew close to Mr. Hampton and whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a poet&mdash;sometimes a great one. You will
see and hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly Akmet struck a new chord, one evidently
to his liking. He repeated it several times&mdash;a
chord so deep and sad it sent a thrill of emotion
through every man there. Then he began to sing
in a pleasing barytone. At first he went slowly,
awkwardly, but soon crowding thoughts expressed
themselves in words fluently and with grace. When
he finished, with a crash, there was not a dry eye.</p>
<p>Ali snuffled and leaned closer to Mr. Hampton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was great that time,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;He
sang of his home in the Sous. That is Berber land,
far to the west of us. He has not been home in
many years, and that was a song of home sickness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great it was,&rdquo; returned Mr. Hampton, &ldquo;but,&rdquo;
he added, with a sidelong glance at the solemn faces
of his son and Frank, &ldquo;tell him to give us something
more cheerful.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>Ali nodded and made his way to the side of
Akmet who sat expressionless in the midst of the
storm of enthusiastic applause from his countrymen
in which the Athensians joined generously. Stooping,
he whispered some words in Akmet&rsquo;s ear at
which the latter nodded imperceptibly and cast a
swift reassuring glance toward Mr. Hampton before
again dropping his eyes.</p>
<p>Then Akmet&rsquo;s fingers struck the lute again. A
new note clanged&mdash;a warlike note, and Akmet began.
There was no need for translator. The Arabs
knew what he said. They sat big-eyed, open-mouthed,
scarcely breathing, under the spell of the
poet. Nobody else knew, but they did not need to
know. It was as clear to them as if they understood
every word. Clear, not alone from the emotions
Akmet aroused within their own breasts but
also from the story written on the faces of the
singer&rsquo;s countrymen.</p>
<p>It was a tale of war. And the swarthy face of
the singer, played upon by the leaping flame, portrayed
every mood. His audience could see the
warriors riding across the barren wastes of the
Great Desert, could hear the clash of scimeters, the
crackle of rifle fire, the whirring flight of arrows
and, at length, the women wailing of death. When
the climax came, it left all tense and wrung dry of
emotion. As for Akmet, his face sunk into an expressionless
mold, he put the lute away, and stared
into the fire, while the Athensians applauded wildly
and the Arabs flung themselves upon him as if merely
to touch his robe would bring them happiness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>Ali was lost in this wave of emotion like the rest.
Presently he extricated himself, and made his way
to Mr. Hampton&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;was the finest story I ever
heard. But I can&rsquo;t translate it for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned abruptly and strode away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew,&rdquo; ejaculated Roy Stone. &ldquo;The beggar
is cocky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mr. Hampton, &ldquo;just stirred profoundly.
Well, so was I. The Arabs, I have heard, are
the greatest story tellers and poets in the world.
They never write their stories, but sing or recite
them, and thus they put into them infinitely more
than the peoples who merely write.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; commented Jack, &ldquo;no story I ever read
held me so enthralled as I was tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And no play or movie I ever saw,&rdquo; added Frank.
&ldquo;I guess that must be true about the Arabs if Akmet
is a fair sample.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After some further desultory conversation, the
four Americans retired for the night. Two Athensians
were sent to the desert to relieve the two on
guard over the airplane, and the little encampment
amidst the ruins of Korakum sank into slumber.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<h2 id="c22">CHAPTER XXII.
<br /><span class="small">FRANK TO THE RESCUE.</span></h2>
<p>All the Americans arose early the next morning,
for they were resolved, if possible, that the day
should see Bob&rsquo;s rescue carried out; at least, should
see it begun.</p>
<p>Nothing untoward had occurred during the night;
the guards at the river reported no danger from the
direction of Athensi, and those in charge of the
airplane, when relieved by two Arabs whom Stone
and the boys accompanied, reported the night had
been uneventful. Leaving the two Arabs in charge,
the three young Americans returned to the grove,
where their own camp was maintained, and found
Mr. Hampton and Ali had breakfast ready, consisting
of coffee, bacon and flapjacks. All ate with
relish, and then turned their attention to plans for
the day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>It had been decided that, if in the gladiators&rsquo;
quarters at Athensi Bob had managed to set up his
radio receiving apparatus, he would already be aware
of plans under way for his rescue, for he would have
been able to listen in on the conversation between
Stone and the camp the day before. Nevertheless,
Frank broadcasted a message, telling Bob to look
for them that day, in the hope that it would reach
him, and adding that he would call later to give
him definite details. Then he rejoined the group,
poring over the map of Athensi drawn by Amrath.</p>
<p>The latter, accompanied by Jepthah and Horeb
put in an appearance while the Americans were bent
over the map, and a lengthy discussion of ways and
means followed.</p>
<p>Athensi lay in a high interior valley. On one
side it was built right up to the edge of a steep
precipitous bluff at the foot of which flowed the
river, which, rising in the mountains behind, flowed
through a series of natural tunnels through intervening
mountains until, emerging in the valley of
Korakum, it disappeared under the Great Mountain
Wall to reappear none knew where.</p>
<p>On this side there was no need for walls, as the
bluff itself could be scaled only by means of a series
of ramps constructed in zigzag fashion, with towers
at every turn. On the other three sides it was enclosed
by high stone walls, which the revolutionists
said were kept in a good state of preservation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>In the middle of the city, a crowded mass of poor
huts and houses sheltering fifty thousand people
reduced by the Oligarchy to a state of serfdom, was
a great open space, two-thirds of which was occupied
by the citadel, the library, the temple, a pyramid on
top of which stood an altar where the sacrifices were
held, and the half dozen great palaces of the court,
all surrounded by a wall. The remaining third of
this great space, outside the wall, was taken up by
the Coliseum. It was of stone, oval in shape, and
in it were held the annual Sacrificial Games.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under those tiers of seats are the gladiators&rsquo;
quarters,&rdquo; explained Amrath, dabbing at the map
with a forefinger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then to get Bob, we&rsquo;ve got to alight in the
Coliseum?&rdquo; asked Jack, drawing in a long breath as
he realized the difficulties. &ldquo;Whew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton&rsquo;s face was grave. Should he give
his consent to such a procedure? Would it not be
merely to throw away the lives of whoever made the
attempt without effecting the rescue of Bob? It
began to appear so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amrath explained all this to me at the oasis,&rdquo;
said Stone. He sat back, quietly regarding Mr.
Hampton. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve got a trick up my sleeve,&rdquo; he
added, &ldquo;which puts a different complexion on the
matter. I didn&rsquo;t speak of this last night because
there was no need or opportunity. But now let me
explain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>&ldquo;Amrath tells me,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that the gladiators
destined to participate in the games are taken
out into the arena every morning and every afternoon
for exercise. In the morning, the young
Athensians who are to be paired with the outside
gladiators are exercised. In the afternoon, the
others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is so,&rdquo; said Jepthah, and Horeb, who
also spoke English, nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On a tower or platform in the middle of the
arena a group of a dozen Janissaries mount guard,&rdquo;
continued Stone, looking to the young Athensians
who confirmed him with nods. &ldquo;If the gladiators
should plan a concerted revolt and attack the Janissaries,
they would be out of luck. Without firearms,
they would be shot down by the Janissaries
without a chance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;if I had no means of combatting
the Janissaries, of putting them out of commission,
in fact, I&rsquo;d be out of luck, too. The minute
I landed in the arena, they&rsquo;d open fire. But&mdash;&rdquo;
He paused and glanced about at the tense faces of
his audience, every man of which hung on his
words. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;what would you say
to dropping gas bombs on them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the &ldquo;trick or two up his sleeve,&rdquo; of
which he had spoken. Its effect was magical.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any such?&rdquo; demanded Frank, excitedly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>&ldquo;A half dozen of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said Stone, complacently.
&ldquo;Enough to put the Janissaries to sleep with lots
left over. I&rsquo;ll drop a gas bomb on their platform,
and if I miss I&rsquo;ll drop another. I can fly low above
them, because I&rsquo;ll have nothing to fear except their
rifle fire, and the old buss is sheathed to protect it
against that. So there will be no reason to miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where did you get these gas bombs?&rdquo; asked
Mr. Hampton, recovering from his surprise, and
beginning to show the relief he experienced as the
possibility of effecting Bob&rsquo;s rescue again grew
bright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hooked &rsquo;em from the Spaniards,&rdquo; said Stone,
unashamedly. &ldquo;I had a run-in with my commander
over the justice of his cause, and as I had to leave
without my pay, I took along the bombs and an
extra supply of gas to compensate. Loaded the
drums of gas in the old buss. The plane&rsquo;s mine,
you know. Bought it in France at an auction of
surplus war supplies, but that&rsquo;s another story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The eyes of Jack and Frank sparkled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; shouted the latter, leaping
to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurray,&rdquo; yelled Jack. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re on our way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, wait a minute,&rdquo; said Roy Stone.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a sixty-mile flight to Athensi, and we&rsquo;ll
be there in less than an hour. We have got to wait,
and to time our departure so as to arrive at the hour
of exercise this afternoon. Even then our friends
here&rdquo;&mdash;indicating the young Athensians&mdash;&ldquo;may
have guessed wrong as to the time of exercising the
alien gladiators, and then we&rsquo;d be up the spout.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jepthah shook his head in negation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>&ldquo;Procedure in Athensi never changes,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Two hours after midday the alien gladiators are
taken into the arena for exercise and training. It
has always been so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Stone, &ldquo;then we start at half past
one to the dot. Now to settle who goes. One of
you boys will have to go to fly the plane. I&rsquo;m the
only one who can drop the gas bombs, so that lets
me out of the flying. And one of the Athensians
will have to go as guide. Amrath wants the job,
and, as I can <i>parlez vous francais</i> and so can understand
him, that&rsquo;s all right. Now which of you two
fellows takes the stick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frank,&rdquo; said Jack instantly.</p>
<p>He himself was dying to undertake the flight, but
he knew the depth of affection between his two
comrades, and not for worlds would he have deprived
Frank of the chance to rescue Bob. Frank,
who had remained silent, regarded his chum gratefully
and reaching out squeezed his hand hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Stone. &ldquo;Frank it is. We can
take only three, because we need the fourth seat for
Bob coming back. And now,&rdquo; he added, rising,
&ldquo;let&rsquo;s go down to the old buss and tune her up, give
her a good overhauling, and run her around a little
with you at the stick, Frank, so you learn her
tricks.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<h2 id="c23">CHAPTER XXIII.
<br /><span class="small">THE FLIERS WARN KORAKUM.</span></h2>
<p>After a hectic morning, all was ready for the
take-off as one-thirty o&rsquo;clock approached. Right up
to the last minute, Frank was kept by Stone at
practising landing and taking-off within a limited
space for, although the description given by the
young revolutionists of the tremendous size of the
arena promised sufficient space for the delicate work
of alighting and re-ascending, yet Frank must be
perfect. Otherwise, if the plane smashed, the expedition
would be wrecked. Once inside of Athensi
and the Coliseum, the only way to escape would be
by means of the plane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>Understanding full well the responsibility resting
upon him, Frank concentrated on the task in hand.
An expert aviator with four years of flying to his
credit, he won the approval of Roy Stone as he
managed the plane in masterly fashion and as his
landings and ascents approached perfection. Finally,
when twice in succession he had landed and re-ascended
within an oval traced on the desert sand
which all the Athensians, who could not recall the
exact measurements of the arena, declared according
to the best of their recollection was even smaller
than that of the Coliseum, Stone ordered him to
cease his efforts and rest for an hour.</p>
<p>At the end of that period, sharp at one-thirty,
the take-off was made.</p>
<p>What a cheering and hullabaloo there was as,
with Frank at the stick, and Stone and Amrath riding
as passengers, the start of the flight was made.
Brilliant sunlight flooded the desert and, gathered
in a group a bit out from the Great Mountain Wall,
revolutionists, Arabs and Jack and Mr. Hampton
waved farewells and called Godspeeds to the expedition.</p>
<p>Amrath occupied the seat beside Frank, for his
was the task of piloting the flight. Stone, sitting
in the rear pit from which had been removed the
drums of gasoline which formed his surplus fuel
supply, in order to make room for Bob on the return
trip, had his gas bombs nicely adjusted. A grim
smile crossed his features as he regarded them. Let
one of those bombs light on the stone platform of
the Janissaries in the middle of the arena, and those
gentlemen would give no trouble to anybody for
quite some time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>Jack and Frank had clasped hands just before the
latter clambered to his seat, and the look in his
eyes told better than words could have done the
gratitude he felt because his chum had stepped aside
unselfishly and given him the opportunity to fly the
plane.</p>
<p>A running start out over the desert, away from
the Great Mountain Wall, a spurning of the sand, a
turn in the air, and then higher and higher mounted
Frank seeking altitude. Those watching from the
sands saw the plane grow smaller and smaller until
it seemed to their sun-dazzled eyes only a mote
dancing in the sun. Then away toward the Great
Mountain Wall headed Frank, crossed its serrated
summit and disappeared.</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton&rsquo;s eyes were moist and his lips
moved soundlessly in a prayer from the heart for
the success of the expedition and the safe return
of all concerned.</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s eyes were unashamedly moist, too, and, as
they trudged back apart from the others, Mr. Hampton&rsquo;s
arm went across his son&rsquo;s shoulders and stayed
there. The two were very close in that hour.</p>
<p>A guard of six, four Athensian revolutionists and
two Arabs, had been left in the valley of Korakum
to watch the river approach. Accordingly, it was
deemed unnecessary for the balance of the party
which had witnessed the start of the flight, to return
at once and, instead, a halt was made under the
trees of the grove where the radio station had been
set up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>Jack took his seat at the instruments, while the
others crowded around, eager to hear the first word
received from the plane with which, of course, constant
communication could be maintained. Earlier,
before going down to the desert after his rest period
to begin the flight, Frank had broadcasted a message
of cheer to Bob, in the faint hope that he might be
able to receive it, telling him of the effort to be made
that afternoon for his rescue.</p>
<p>At once Jack began calling, and back came
Stone&rsquo;s voice in re-assuring accents almost immediately,
telling that they had cleared the Mountain
Wall in handsome style, that the plane was performing
flawlessly, and that even the cross-currents of
wind which tugged at them, sweeping down valleys
and canyons and around mountain peaks, seemed
to make no difference to Frank. To the latter&rsquo;s
skill, Stone paid handsome tribute.</p>
<p>All this Jack repeated to his auditors and Ali and
Jepthah interpreted for the Arabs and the revolutionists
respectively. Jepthah had stayed to witness
the start of the expedition instead of rejoining his
command and now intended to wait the few hours
more which would tell its outcome.</p>
<p>Suddenly, excitement seized Jack. His brow
contracted, his eyes blazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say that again,&rdquo; he shouted into the transmitter.</p>
<p>A moment of concentrated listening, then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll tell them. How far away, did you
say? Twenty-five miles of straight flying. All right,
all right. We&rsquo;ll be ready for them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>Tearing off the headset in his eagerness, he
whirled around to the crowd which, alarmed by his
tone even though the words were not understood by
most, had drawn close about him. His eyes sought
and found Jepthah and him he addressed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an attack against Korakum coming by
way of the river. As the airplane crossed a gorge
twenty-five miles from here through which the subterranean
river ran exposed, Amrath counted three
boatloads of armed men making their way toward
Korakum. There may be more. He didn&rsquo;t see
them. About twelve men in a boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, they are not advancing on Korakum,&rdquo;
suggested Mr. Hampton.</p>
<p>Jepthah shook his head in negation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They could be going nowhere else,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Well, thanks to our friends, we are warned. We
shall be ready for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning, he issued a crisp order in Athensian
which caused the revolutionists in the group to dart
away at once. Their bare legs flashed as they raced
through the grove, then they leaped over the underbrush
at the edge of the terrace without even seeking
out the path which had been cut through it, and
started running up the Great Road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Arabs,&rdquo; said Jepthah, tersely, to Mr.
Hampton, &ldquo;can we count on them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are free agents,&rdquo; said the latter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask
Ali.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>The latter, standing close at hand, did not wait
to be appealed to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are at your command, sir,&rdquo; he said to
Jepthah.</p>
<p>Between this educated Arab with his cosmopolitan
experience and air of mystery, and all the young
Athensian revolutionists, had developed a warm
feeling of mutual liking and respect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it,&rdquo; said Jepthah. &ldquo;Good. Would you
take your men and report at once to Lieutenant
Horeb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The latter had not gone down the Great Road to
witness the start of the flight, but had remained in
command of the tunnel guard.</p>
<p>Ali gave a quick nod, more eloquent than words,
said something in Arabic to his four companions,
whose eyes gleamed with satisfaction at the prospect
of a fight, and without more ado the five set out in
pursuit of the revolutionists.</p>
<p>Only Jack, Mr. Hampton and Jepthah were left
in the little grove. Even the camels were missing,
having been taken to the valley of Korakum to
graze. Hardly had the last Arab disappeared up
the Great Road than the clatter of hoofs was heard
approaching, and a man on horseback dashed by
making for the desert at a break-neck pace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-five miles away,&rdquo; explained Jepthah.
&ldquo;The river flows swiftly, and they will row besides.
Yet they cannot reach Korakum for an hour or
more. I ordered one of the men to ride to the other
pass and bring help. Thirty-six men will outnumber
us two to one, and it is more than likely there
will be many more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can help arrive from the other pass in time?&rdquo;
asked Mr. Hampton, anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not before the attack begins,&rdquo; answered Jepthah.
&ldquo;But we will have the advantage, and can hold the
enemy off, for a time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The defenders of Korakum had thrown up earth
works at each bank of the river, where it broke from
the interior mountain range into the valley. Besides,
for a considerable distance along the river, inside
the tunnel, they had dumped heaps of big rocks
which rose close to the surface and against which, in
the gloom, carried along by the swift current, boats
approaching from Athensi would be smashed.
Where the river emerged into the open, strong nets
had been spread under the surface, staked down to
the banks, and sharp stakes also had been driven
into the river bottom.</p>
<p>The result was that boats approaching from
Athensi would have a perilous gauntlet to run.
Smashed against the rocks inside the tunnel, their
occupants would be carried along into the nets and,
if they managed to get through these, they would be
involved in the sharpened sunken stakes below. All
the time, rifle fire would be playing on them from
the earthworks, and showers of arrows would be
whirring into their midst.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>Determined men, of course, could effect a landing,
but only at a tremendous loss of life. It was said
of the Athensian Janissaries, however, that they
were absolutely fearless. Their ranks were recruited
from the sturdiest, strongest sons of the peasants,
seized from their homes before old enough to have
imbibed the popular hatred of the Oligarchs and
trained in the practise of arms at Athensi. They
never saw their relatives again and became mere
creatures of the Oligarchy. Knowing they were
hated and despised by the people as traitors to their
blood, and that if captured they would be slain
without mercy, they fought with unparalleled
ferocity when employed to quell the numerous
rebellions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<h2 id="c24">CHAPTER XXIV.
<br /><span class="small">INTO THE COLISEUM.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re approaching Athensi. Boy, what a
place. We can see the arena. We&rsquo;re over it and
Frank is dropping the old buss. Now he&rsquo;s pancaking,
and they&rsquo;re beginning to shoot at us from the
platform, and the&mdash;Well, say, I&rsquo;ll talk to you later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roy Stone&rsquo;s voice ended abruptly. Jack turned
to his father, who was pacing up and down the
grove, listening for word from Jack, listening too
for sounds from Korakum which would indicate the
arrival of the Janissaries and the beginning of the
attack, torn between conflicting emotions, eager to
hear of the outcome of the attempt to rescue Bob,
and desirous also of doing his part to beat off the
Janissaries, and called to his anxious parent the
purport of Stone&rsquo;s last message.</p>
<p>The two looked at each other. At that moment,
the sound of rifle fire came to them from the direction
of Korakum. Mr. Hampton seized his rifle
and started up the Great Road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take care of yourself, Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>Jack was to stay and hear the outcome of the
daring attempt to rescue Bob. He felt a strange
tightness of the throat as his father disappeared.
Would he ever see him again? Would he ever see
Bob and Frank again? What was to be the outcome
of it all?</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Less than an hour from the time of taking-off,
Frank nosed the airplane through a gorge between
towering mountains the sides of which were cultivated
in terraces half-way to the summits. Men,
women and children, at work in the fields, stood
paralyzed with terror, unable to move, this strange
monster of the air zoomed along. But those in the
plane paid them no attention.</p>
<p>They were watching a point ahead, where the
two sides of the gorge drew closer together until
they were less than a quarter-mile apart. Beyond
they glimpsed a great open plain, in the distance,
beside a pencilled cleft, the walls of a city at the
heart of which rose a clump of great buildings. Only
a glimpse they caught, and then the converging
walls of the gorge shut out the sight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>Steady as a rock, seemingly without a nerve in
his body, Frank whipped the plane between the
narrowest point of the mountain walls and found
that the valley opened out abruptly at once. In a
minute or two, as they zoomed along, the mountains
had retreated miles away on either hand, they were
flying over an intensely cultivated plain, the river
flowing below in a gorge that cut through the heart
of the plain, and the walls of the city seeming to
leap into gigantic size ahead.</p>
<p>No longer did Frank require directions from
Amrath as to how to proceed. Everything lay clear
below&mdash;the city walls, the crowding hovels within,
and in the middle the walled inner city of the
Oligarchy with the Coliseum at its gates. Over the
Coliseum he passed, began to spiral, and then pancaked.
It was then Roy Stone called his last message
to Jack, as with gas bomb ready, he prepared
to do his part.</p>
<p>Against the metal bottom of the plane came the
tiny ping of a rifle bullet or two, but for the most
part the shots of the Janissaries on the tower went
wild. The ground seemed rushing up to meet them.
Throughout the vast oval, surrounded by its banked
tiers of empty stone seats, little groups and pairs of
men paused in their movements as if stricken, turned
into stone, at the sight of this strange monster overhead.</p>
<p>Only, from one group, a figure darted away,
running along the hard-packed sand of the oval,
eyes uplifted, arms waving wildly. As Frank
glanced down, his eyes as if drawn by the force of
that ant-like figure&rsquo;s gaze, singled it out of all below.
In his heart he knew it was Bob, and that,
whether he had received their radioed messages or
not, Bob realized friends were at hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>Then below him there was a crash, followed by
another, and he knew Roy Stone had landed his
gas bombs on the stone platform of the Janissaries,
in the very center of the arena. Had they fallen
into the sand, no such sound would have followed.</p>
<p>He could not delay to gauge the effects of the gas
bombs. He must take it for granted they had put
the guards out of business, and proceed to land.
Even if any Janissaries were left to shoot at them,
the chance must be taken. The airplane could not
hover longer without being brought into descent, or
it would crash. Further, they must operate swiftly,
or the gas wave would sweep over the arena and put
them out of business, too. Against this contingency,
Frank was guarded, but not the others. Roy
Stone had one gas mask, but only one, and Frank
had been provided with it, as upon him as flier
depended the ultimate safety of all.</p>
<p>For one thing he was grateful. The Athensian
revolutionists, if anything, had underestimated the
vast extent of the Coliseum. The arena oval alone
was longer than a city block, and between the stone
platform of the guards and the sides was room for
three planes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>Down swept the plane and Frank, even though
his eyes were glued to the course, out of the tail of
them saw a thin vapor mushrooming above the
guard&rsquo;s platform which he knew must be the released
cloud of gas. Not a shot came from the platform
as they swooped past. Ahead, the gladiators
had run from the path of the oncoming plane to
throw themselves prone at the base of the surrounding
wall.</p>
<p>All except one. He&mdash;a strange figure cumbered
in heavy armor, of breastplate, and greaves on
thighs and calves&mdash;was running parallel to them and
waving. Evidently, too, he was shouting, but even
though the motor was shut off his words could not
be heard. There was no doubt, however, of his
identity. He had torn off and cast aside a helmet
with overhanging crest, and his yellow hair was
bare and gleaming in the sun.</p>
<p>It was Bob.</p>
<p>The wheels of the plane touched the oval, but likewise
the end wall seemed rushing to meet the charge.
Frank set his teeth, worked the tail, and the big
machine swung gracefully in a circle, the outer wing
not a foot from the stone wall above which rose the
tiers of seats, and came to rest.</p>
<p>From the middle where he had thrown himself
flat on the sand while Frank executed his maneuvre,
Bob regaining his feet sprang for the plane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In with you, quick,&rdquo; cried Stone, lending a hand,
and Bob half-clambered, half was dragged into the
rear pit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>Frank pressed the starter, and the engine, still
on compression, resumed operations with a roar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your noses,&rdquo; yelled Roy Stone, &ldquo;I smell
the gas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sweetish acrid fumes, in fact, were in their
nostrils. Frank set the plane in motion down the
arena, himself immune because of his mask, while
the others sat with noses pinched between thumb
and forefinger and eyes screwed shut. Down the
sand tore the plane and when near the platform in
the center it began to lift. Up, up, it went, yet not
as swiftly as Frank could have wished. As the far
end of the Coliseum was approached, he experienced
a sick panic that they would not be able to rise fast
enough to clear the banked-up seats.</p>
<p>Banking as steeply as possible, he began to swing
obliquely, and this maneuvre, dangerous to equilibrium,
though it was at such a low altitude, and before
speed had been picked up, had the desired effect.
The widening arc of the Coliseum gave him just
enough room for operations so that as he drew near
the side he was able to drag the plane over the top
tier of seats.</p>
<p>Yet how little room there was to spare was
brought home to all with ominous significance, for,
as they cleared the top of the lofty stone seats, there
came a shock, and a quiver shook the plane which
caused Frank to struggle desperately. The next
moment they were free and mounting rapidly and
the danger was passed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>&ldquo;We bumped with our wheels,&rdquo; cried Stone.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t see &rsquo;em behind us, so I guess they weren&rsquo;t
torn off, but you&rsquo;ll have a sweet time landing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little nod of the head was all Frank&rsquo;s reply.
What cared he about a messy landing? He could
manage not to hurt anybody seriously. And any damage
to the plane would be more than compensated for
by Mr. Hampton. The big thing was that Bob was
safe, safe; that he, Frank, had been able to fly a
plane in and out of the Coliseum and rescue his big
chum.</p>
<p>A hand closing hard on his shoulder from the
rear sent a thrill throughout his body, and a bellowing
voice shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got your message, old kid. Knew you could
do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was all, but that was enough. No matter
what praise others might bestow, Frank cared
naught.</p>
<p>High over Athensi he circled, seeking his bearing
for the mountain pass, before darting away, true as
a bird. And from their lofty altitude, the others
looked down. Now that it was all over, the experience
seemed like a dream. In the minds of both Amrath
and Roy Stone, still lingered thankfulness for their
amazing escape from disaster and wonder at it, too,
yet exultation over the success of the daring attempt
rapidly replaced all other thoughts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>As for Bob, it would be hard to describe the chaos
of his thoughts. He had never quite despaired of
being saved by his friends, yet when once his captors
had reached and entered their mountain country he
had realized that nothing less than a miracle could
save him. Practising at arms day after day with
trainers, cooped at other times in the gladiators&rsquo;
quarters deep beneath the great stone pile of the
Coliseum, he had seen no possible way of escaping.
Heart and brain had turned sick at the thought of
giving up his life to make holiday for semi-savages.</p>
<p>One of his trainers he had bribed with the gift
of his gold watch to bring him the coils of wire and
the collapsible standards for setting up the antenna.
This same trainer had erected the antenna amid the
tiers of empty seats, which would not be occupied
until the Sacrificial Games and so, finally, Bob had
managed to get his little radio set to working.</p>
<p>Only very faintly had he heard the messages sent
out by the boys from Korakum, and numbers of
the words could not be heard, try as he might to
tune up. The trainer, receiving his bribe, had
shown no further interest in the radio, the use of
which was altogether unknown to him. As for the
other prisoners, Negroes of various tribes, they were
either sunk in apathy and paid Bob no attention, or
else out of some vague notion of respect for the
white man kept their distance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>Thus Bob was not spied upon nor reported. And,
faint though the words he did hear, yet he understood
enough to realize an effort to rescue him by
airplane was to be made that afternoon.</p>
<p>How he had seized the opportunity is known.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<h2 id="c25">CHAPTER XXV.
<br /><span class="small">A SURPRISE FOR THE JANISSARIES.</span></h2>
<p>As, flying over the rugged mountain country,
they whirled back toward Korakum, Roy Stone bethought
him of Jack. Thereupon he opened communication,
and Bob himself announced to his other
chum the tale of his own rescue.</p>
<p>From Jack the party in the plane learned that the
attack on Korakum via the subterranean river had
begun fifteen minutes before, and was proceeding
fiercely so far as Jack could tell from the distant
sounds of rifle fire. His anxiety regarding the fate
of his father and of the small band of Athensian
rebels and Arabs communicated itself to them.</p>
<p>Instead of flying straight out to the desert and
landing, it was decided to follow a route which
would bring them over the scene of conflict, if for
no other reason than to learn how affairs progressed.
Should the revolutionists be forced to flee, it would
not be safe for the airplane to land on the desert
near the Great Road, inasmuch as, with damaged
wheels, it would not be able to re-ascend and would
be captured, even if they escaped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>Besides, as Roy Stone pointed out, there was the
bare possibility that they might be able to render
help. Four gas bombs remained. If the Janissaries
had managed to effect a landing and were in considerable
force, dropping of the gas bombs amongst
them would wreak havoc.</p>
<p>Accordingly, under Amrath&rsquo;s guidance, Frank
altered his course and presently, after scaling the
mountain range blocking the upper end of Korakum
valley, dropped down spiralling above the plain.</p>
<p>Amrath had glasses to his eyes and was studying
the scene below. Evidently, the fight had gone
against the revolutionists. No longer did they hold
the earth works at the tunnel mouth, although heaps
of bodies entangled among the stakes in the river
and lying thick along the river bank and up to the
top of the ramparts showed they had wreaked deadly
execution before retiring.</p>
<p>Retiring now they were, however, but in good
order. The horses of the revolutionists and the
camels of Mr. Hampton and his party had been
brought up in readiness for a quick retreat, and
mounted upon them the defenders were fleeing down
the valley, well in advance of the Janissaries. The
latter, afoot, were rapidly being outdistanced.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>That there had been losses amongst the defenders
was only too sadly apparent. Of the gallant little
band of eighteen, ten Athensians and Mr. Hampton,
Ali and their six Arabs, only a dozen were left. But
Amrath&rsquo;s glasses showed him bundles being borne
away with them by the living, and he knew them
for the bodies of those who either had been wounded
or slain. Perhaps, they had only been wounded.</p>
<p>Where the walls of the pass through which ran
the Great Road out from ancient Korakum to the
desert drew close together, the revolutionists, anticipating
the necessity for falling back in case of
attack, had thrown up a strong barricade across the
pass from wall to wall. For this they were making
and even as he watched, Amrath saw them pass in
single file through a breach left for that purpose.
He knew that they would drop into place a sheath
of timbers and prepare for a final stand.</p>
<p>Rapidly the result of his observations were communicated
to his companions, and Roy Stone
radioed them to Jack. The latter was wild with
anxiety for his father, and announced he would take
his rifle and go to the barricade to offer his assistance.
He explained a messenger had left for the
other pass on receipt of the warning from the airplane
of impending attack, but that so far help had
not arrived.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tell the fellows at the barricade to keep up their
courage,&rdquo; was Stone&rsquo;s last message to Jack, before
the latter abandoned the radio station. &ldquo;Tell them
to watch. I&rsquo;m going to drop our gas bombs among
the Janissaries. They&rsquo;re marching bunched up and
we ought to put a lot of them to sleep. Although
we saw only three boatloads on their way here, there
must have been a lot more, because there&rsquo;s a thousand
at least on the march below us. Well, here
goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack did not stay to hear Roy Stone&rsquo;s closing
words, however, for at the report of the danger to
the revolutionists he was off to see about his father,
and Roy spoke to the empty air.</p>
<p>Frank swooped low above the close-packed mass
of the Janissaries, streaming down the Great Road.
High in the air he shut off his engine, and not many
had warning of his approach. Even those who did
merely gaped at the strange and terrifying sight
instead of scattering.</p>
<p>Straight down the line of the Great Road flew
Frank, and in succession Roy Stone released and
dropped the gas bombs. Into the crowded ranks
they fell. Not one missed the road. And, as they
struck, the clouds of vapor were released.</p>
<p>The airplane passed on and Frank, switching on
the engine, mounted and then turned to go back
over their course and observe what effect their
bombs had caused.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>Deadly, indeed, the execution wrought. Where
a few minutes before the Great Road had been alive
with marching men, now it was a chaos of writhing
forms strangling in the powerful fumes. Many
already lay still. Ahead and behind the main body,
others fled, stumbling, falling, rising, dashing on, to
get away from the unseen enemy that had laid their
comrades low. To either side fled still others.</p>
<p>Although Roy Stone had assured him in advance
that the gas was not fatal in its effects, the
spectacle caused Frank to experience a sickish feeling.
How terrible it was, he thought, that men
should thus be struck down in masses. Even the
fact that the Janissaries were atrociously brutal, and
richly deserved the worst of fates, was no comfort.</p>
<p>Abruptly, he turned and started to mount into the
air, heading for the desert. As they passed high
above the barricade, Amrath through his glasses
could see the defenders busied closing the breach
and preparing for a last desperate stand. Not yet
were they aware of what had occurred in the valley,
for the scene was hidden from them. A little figure,
speeding up the Great Road, was seen and was
presumed to be that of Jack. Well, he would let
the defenders know in a moment that the airplane
had done its part, and that an attack in force from
the Janissaries need not be looked for, at least not
for some time to come.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>Now for a landing. Emerging from the pass,
Frank mounted high and then, with engine shut off,
began to descend on a long gradual slide, intending
to pancake at the end and to drop as lightly as
possible. With the wheels torn loose, as they suspected,
any other method of alighting would be impossible.
They would be shaken up, but would have
to brace themselves for the shock and take things
as easily as possible.</p>
<p>While they were still in the air, they saw in the
distance dashing along the base of the Great Mountain
Wall, a score of mounted revolutionists, followed
by a considerable number afoot, and knew
that aid for the defenders of the barricade was on the
way. Well, thanks to Roy Stone&rsquo;s gas bombs, the
effects of which had incapacitated a large portion of
the Janissaries, the re-inforcements would be in time.</p>
<p>In fact, sweeping into the valley of Korakum,
they would be able to turn the tables on the enemy.
These thoughts rushed through the minds of all, as
Amrath communicated the meaning of the tiny
figures which, as he alone carried glasses, were
plainest to him.</p>
<p>Then came the pancake, and the final drop. But
in the end the plane received little damage nor were
its occupants much thrown about. The carriage
holding the wheels, torn loose in front when the
wheels scraped the upper edge of the Coliseum&rsquo;s
tiers of seats, was still firmly fastened at the rear.
Thus, the wheels hung slantwise. Had Frank,
ignorant of what had occurred, attempted the usual
landing, the results would have been disastrous. But
by pancaking and dropping, the wheels were pushed
up against the bottom of the plane and held firmly
in place, instead of being torn entirely from the
fastenings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>The result was that the plane, although racketted
about a bit, suffered no more than in a bumpy landing,
and came to rest without burying nose or wings
in the sand as had been feared would be the case.</p>
<p>All climbed stiffly out, and the next minute Frank
and Bob were hugging each other like a couple of
kids, and thumping each other on the back with
terrific whacks. In the meantime, Roy Stone and
Amrath stood aside, and it was not until Frank and
he had pummelled each other to their mutual satisfaction
that Bob turned to the aviator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t had much chance for personal conversation
with you up there in the plane, Stone,&rdquo; he said,
as he wrung the other&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;But I want to tell
you&mdash;Oh, shucks, what&rsquo;s the use? I can&rsquo;t sling
language much. Only, I will say I never got more
benefit out of a fight in my life than out of that one
with you in the cave back in Old Mexico.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roy Stone grinned through the sun-wrinkles about
his eyes. He knew Bob&rsquo;s reference was to the affray
between the two parties in the lonely mountains of
Old Sonora, when the boys were striving to rescue
Mr. Hampton from the hands of the Mexican rebels.
At that time, as recorded in &ldquo;The Radio Boys on
the Mexican Border,&rdquo; Stone had been in the rebel
forces. But later he changed his allegiance, and
warm, indeed, had been the friendship between him
and the boys, particularly between him and Bob,
who had been his own individual opponent in the
fight in the cave.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>&ldquo;You like fighting so much,&rdquo; said Stone, &ldquo;that
it&rsquo;s a wonder you consented to let us take you away
from the Coliseum back there in Athensi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob shook his head and threw up his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fellow can get too much of any good thing,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s snap into it and go back to
this place where our friends are fighting. Maybe
we can help a little. But first I&rsquo;m going to leave
this hardware here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon he stripped off the various pieces of
heavy armor and tossed them into the pit of the
airplane, standing revealed in nothing but a G
string&mdash;a superb figure who caused Amrath, for
one, to draw in a breath of admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur would have been a hard man to beat
in the Sacrificial Games,&rdquo; he said in French.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, forget it,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;Come on. Got to
give Jack and Mr. Hampton a hand.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<h2 id="c26">CHAPTER XXVI.
<br /><span class="small">THE REVOLUTIONISTS SUCCEED.</span></h2>
<p>In advance of the mounted re-inforcements from
the other pass, which still were some distance in the
rear, the four adventurers entered the Great Road
and started at a trot up the gradual ascent, Bob in
the lead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hear any firing yet, do you?&rdquo; he shouted
over his shoulder to the others. &ldquo;You fellows have
got revolvers, but I&rsquo;m going to hop ahead and root
for one in the luggage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frank had explained about the grove where their
own party was encamped and where the radio had
been set up. It was here Bob intended to look for
his automatic, which he had not taken with him
when departing from the distant oasis on that
memorable ostrich hunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much use this, unless at close quarters,&rdquo; he
called, waving a short, heavy sword of hard wood&mdash;a
dummy weapon which he had been using against
a trainer when rescued from the Coliseum. &ldquo;Might
brain a man with it, but that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>With a farewell wave of the wooden sword, Bob&rsquo;s
naked figure drew away from the others. It was
late afternoon, and the Great Road already lay in
the shadow cast by the western wall of the pass.
Hot though it was, the relief from the heat of the
desert was instantaneous, and the others felt it at
once and began to increase their speed.</p>
<p>As they passed abreast of the grove, Bob emerged,
flourishing his automatic, the dummy sword left
behind. As he fell in beside them he cried with a
grin:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m all dressed up now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite their labored breathing, the others could
not restrain a laugh at the ridiculous idea of a naked
man considering himself dressed with a revolver.</p>
<p>After all, their services were not needed. When
they arrived at the barricade, they found the defenders
still awaiting the attack which had failed
to materialize. Jack&rsquo;s earlier arrival with Roy
Stone&rsquo;s message that he intended to drop gas bombs
in the midst of the Janissaries had given them the
solution of the mystery, and the explanation of the
fliers regarding the damage wrought was greeted
with delight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>The little band had suffered slightly by comparison
with the terrible execution they had worked
among the Janissaries at the tunnel exit of the subterranean
river. Yet their losses had been severe
enough. Lieutenant Horeb and one of his men had
been killed; Akmet, two other Arabs, and three
revolutionists had suffered dangerous, though not
fatal, injuries, and not one had escaped without
some slight wound.</p>
<p>To the boys the fact that Mr. Hampton, praised
by all for covering the retreat with his repeater, had
come through safely with no more than a flesh
wound in the calf of his right leg, was a matter for
the greatest thankfulness. As the three of them
foregathered with Mr. Hampton and Roy Stone, a
little to one side of the main group, the thought
occurred to all that they had reason, indeed, for
gratitude at having passed practically unscathed
through their numerous and deadly perils.</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton, who was not given to outward
religious manifestations, said simply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almighty Providence has looked after us all,
fellows, and we mustn&rsquo;t forget to give thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And for a moment, each bowed his head and
voiced the thankfulness in his heart in his own way.</p>
<p>A clatter of approaching hoofs rang in the road,
and up dashed the score of hard-riding horsemen
from the other pass, for whom Jepthah had
despatched the messenger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>A condensed account of events was given their
leader, a lean hard-bitten man older than the
majority of the young revolutionists whom, the
boys later learned was Maspah, a nobleman whose
gorge had risen at the terrible punishment meted out
by the Oligarchy to those earlier exiles who had
shown kindness to Professor Souchard and
aided his return to civilization, and who forthwith
had fled to join the little outlaw bands which finally
concentrated at Korakum under Captain Amanassar
and launched the revolution.</p>
<p>His eyes gleamed when he was told of the demoralization
wrought among the Janissaries by the
dropping of the gas bombs. While waiting the
arrival of the footmen, peasants armed with bows
and arrows and numbering 200, he had the breach
re-opened to admit the passage of his horsemen.</p>
<p>In the meantime, too, scouts were sent ahead with
glasses furnished by Amrath and Mr. Hampton,
who had worn his in a case slung over his shoulder,
to mount into the tops of a grove of date palms just
beyond the mouth of the pass and inspect the valley.
They returned presently with word that in the
distance, where the gas bombs had fallen, the Great
Road was still littered with men, but that to the
left of this spot, in the cleared space in front of the
ruins of the ancient temple, where the revolutionists
had been accustomed to hold their meetings, officers
were re-assembling the scattered Janissaries not
struck down by the gas. A considerable number,
perhaps four or five hundred, were collecting.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Maspah looked thoughtful.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>&ldquo;They will be better armed than we,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Yet we have thirty horsemen, which gives us a
big advantage and if we strike at once we shall
have the advantage of surprise, while if we delay
they will recover from their demoralization. Ah,
here come the footmen,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I shall attack
at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only four of the camels of the Hampton party
had been brought in, the others having lumbered
away to their grazing grounds in a distant
portion of the valley when their masters had been
wounded. Akmet and his two companions had been
carried to the barricade on the camels of their comrades.
But from mounting these four camels, Ali
and his remaining Arabs could not be dissuaded.
Their blood was up and they wanted a hand in the
last phase of the battle.</p>
<p>This left no mounts for the boys and Roy Stone,
which caused Bob, who wanted to &ldquo;take a crack&rdquo;
at the bloody rascals, as he expressed it, to grumble
exceedingly. Mr. Hampton, however, was pleased
that it should be so, as he felt the lives of all had
been risked sufficiently. Besides, he had undertaken
to look after the wounded, who as yet lay on the
roadside in the shadow of the western wall, and he
needed aid to transport them to the shade of their
own camp in the grove where, with medical instruments
and drugs, he could make shift to probe
wounds, extract bullets, bandage and do his best to
ease pain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>&ldquo;The four of you,&rdquo; he said to his son and Frank,
Bob and Roy, &ldquo;can do vastly more good helping
me than out there in Korakum. We need litters to
move these fellows to the grove, so hurry back, cut
down some of those young trees coming up in the
brush, and then return. Make your best speed, too.
I&rsquo;ll go along and get out my supplies and have
everything ready to do what I can when you bring
me the wounded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An hour later, word arrived by messenger sent
back by Amrath, who knew Mr. Hampton would
be anxious to hear the result of the battle, that the
Janissaries had put up only a feeble resistance in
their demoralized state and that, after being badly
cut up by the horsemen, they had surrendered. A
little later Ali and his Arabs returned, unwounded,
swaggering a bit, and gave them a lurid account of
the fight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<h2 id="c27">CHAPTER XXVII.
<br /><span class="small">ATHENSI FALLS.</span></h2>
<p>After all these events culminating in the rescue
of Bob and the disastrous rout of the Janissaries at
Korakum, Mr. Hampton decided instead of returning
to civilization without having accomplished his
main objective&mdash;namely, the exploration of the
ruins of Korakum and the gaining of entrance to
Athensi&mdash;to stay and await the result of the
revolution.</p>
<p>The Korakum expedition had been timed by the
Oligarchs to coincide with an attack in force
launched through the mountains against Captain
Amanassar&rsquo;s main body of revolutionists in the field.
There, too, the Janissaries had been unsuccessful.
Though not beaten so decisively as at Korakum,
they had been unable to penetrate the strong position
held by the rebels and, sullen and alarmed at
the unexpected strength of the opposition, they had
fallen back to the shelter of the walls of Athensi.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>In their retreat they carried off all the livestock for
miles from the country between Captain Amanassar
and the city, stripping the poor peasants of everything,
and herding the young men into the city while
leaving the children and the old people to live as
best they might.</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton made a trip to Captain Amanassar&rsquo;s
camp, into which the stricken country people from
the devastated districts were making their way, and
on his return reported many pitiable sights. The
rebel leader&rsquo;s assurance that the fall of Athensi, in
view of the two disasters to the arms of its defenders,
was inevitable, caused the American to
decide to stay.</p>
<p>He was moved by more than an explorer&rsquo;s interest,
moreover. Deeply stirred by the ideals of these
young Athensians, sons of a semi-savage race dating
from the dawn of time, who were resolved to redeem
their country from the rule of the Oligarchs who
so long had held it in thrall, he felt that his engineering
experience would be valuable in the final
siege of the city and that later his knowledge of
world affairs would be worth much to Captain
Amanassar when the latter and his compatriots
came to the point of opening communication with
the outside world.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>Week by week the lines about Athensi grew
tighter, with every sally of the Janissaries repulsed.
Reports from friends within the city, where the
revolutionists had many adherents, continued to
reach the rebel camp, and all were to the effect that
famine was beginning to raise its head amid the
crowded population.</p>
<p>That great numbers of his countrymen should be
starved to death or die of plague, for sickness also
broke out in Athensi, was not Captain Amanassar&rsquo;s
object. On several occasions, he made overtures to
the Oligarchs looking to the surrender of the city
on terms which would spare their lives, but these
were all rejected. The rulers of the priest clan
could not bring themselves to a realization that at
last the power they had exercised through uncounted
centuries was seriously threatened, and
seemed bent on involving all in ruin rather than continue
to live shorn of power. To storm Athensi
was an impossibility for Captain Amanassar&rsquo;s
numerous but ill-equipped army, and apparently the
only thing to do was to play a waiting game.</p>
<p>Such a course, however, was repugnant to the
rebel leader, whose heart bled for the miseries of
the cooped-up population, and he sought by every
known method of appeal to prevail on those residents
who managed to steal out of Athensi and
reach his camp, to bring about an uprising in the
city which would open its gates to his forces.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>At length, when the miseries of the city reached
a point too great to be borne any longer, his arguments
prevailed. A half dozen of his stoutest-hearted
aides entered Athensi with a drove of lean
cattle, announcing boldly they had been burned out
by the rebels and came to the city for shelter. They
disappeared amid the city warrens after being admitted
at the great gate, and then scattered to rouse
the city to fever pitch.</p>
<p>That night the Janissaries, going to change guard
on the walls, were attacked as they passed through
the streets, and were driven back to the shelter of
the Inner City. The guard at the great gate was
surprised and overcome, and the gates opened to
admit a force of picked warriors from the rebel
ranks, who had stolen up under cover of darkness.</p>
<p>The Janissaries posted on the walls in the vicinity
of the gate were overcome, although fighting desperately,
and before help could reach them from
other parts of the walls, the main force of the rebels,
which had moved up by forced marches, entered
the city.</p>
<p>Many of the Janissaries were cut down as they
fell back to the Inner City, where their heartless
comrades refused to open the gates to admit them
lest the rebels also force their way in.</p>
<p>Dawn found Athensi in the possession of Captain
Amanassar&rsquo;s forces, with the Inner City beleaguered
on every side, and its fall only a matter
of time. Three weeks it managed to hold out and
then its defenders weak from hunger, were forced
to seek unconditional surrender. The Oligarchs
were imprisoned to stand trial later for their crimes,
and the surviving Janissaries were disarmed and,
although their lives were spared, they were put to
work as state peons repairing the ravaged countryside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>Bob, Jack, Frank and Roy Stone followed the
first wave of the attack into Athensi in a company
of 200 rebels commanded by Jepthah. At Bob&rsquo;s
special request, this group made its way through
the tumultuous streets to the Coliseum. It was a
moonless night, and the great amphitheater lay dark
and mysterious outside the walls of the Inner City.</p>
<p>Around those walls raged a furious battle but in
the Coliseum itself, which the Janissaries had no
idea of defending, all was silent. That is, until the
rebels with Bob at their head, clad again in the
gladiator&rsquo;s armor he had worn on being rescued,
entered the arena with their wavering torches.</p>
<p>The tumult of the desperate fighting within the
city was reduced to a murmur down there, on the
sand, at the base of those towering tiers of seats.
Yet here, too, it had penetrated and the poor captives,
locked in their quarters for the night, and
awaiting the coming of the Sacrificial Games, now
only a week away, were awake and moving about
restlessly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>As the light of the torches fell through the massive
bars of the great door set in the solid stone of the
wall, and penetrated the interior of the single great
room where all the alien gladiators were quartered
and where Bob, too, had lived, the poor fellows
crowded forward.</p>
<p>They did not know what the tumult in the city
and now the arrival of this armed force portended,
but Bob was easily recognizable in his armor and
made friendly signs indicating he had come to release
them. At the same time, men armed with
stout axes and wrenching bars attacked the gate.
It was stubborn and resisted all assaults a long time
but eventually gave way, and then the slaves threw
themselves at Bob&rsquo;s feet and tried to kiss his hands.
To these men, most of whom were Negroes, although
a few Berbers and Tuaregs were in the number,
Bob&rsquo;s sudden rescue by airplane had appeared as a
miracle. And now his return to release them had an
even greater effect on their primitive intelligences.</p>
<p>While this was going on Jepthah headed another
party which broke down a similar gate on the other
side of the arena, behind which were confined the
young Athensians destined to fight the slaves in
the Sacrificial Games. To one or two of them he
was known, and when he spread the word of the
success of the revolution the joy of these young
fellows, snatched from their families by the
Oligarchs to go to death, knew no bounds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<h2 id="c28">CHAPTER XXVIII.
<br /><span class="small">CONCLUSION.</span></h2>
<p>After the final capitulation of the Oligarchy, Mr.
Hampton and the members of his party went to live
in quarters assigned them in one of the palaces of
the Inner City. It was an age-worn stone structure
of immensely thick walls, two stories in height, and
covering five acres of ground. In it were hundreds
of rooms and apartments, sumptuously appointed
with many luxuries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, this business of living in a palace,&rdquo;
said Bob, one day. &ldquo;Just the same I for one can
never accustom myself to living in a tomb. And
that&rsquo;s what this seems like, with its old stone walls
and courts and secret passages, and what not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this opinion, Jack and Frank were in hearty
agreement. Likewise Roy Stone, who after repairing
his airplane had flown it to the plain outside
Athensi where it rested now with just sufficient fuel
to carry him out of the desert when the time came
to depart. Departure, however, he kept putting off
from time to time at the insistence of his friends.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>Ali and his Arabs continued to stay with Mr.
Hampton, the wounded members of the party now
fully restored to health.</p>
<p>In the Great Library of Athensi, the biggest
building in extent within the Inner City, were found
as the revolutionists had predicted many thousands
of manuscripts or papyrus rolls written in the ancient
mother tongue of Atlantis of which Athensian was
a corruption. Few of the young nobles among the
revolutionists ever had been within the library before,
as the ancients of the Oligarchs had guarded
it jealously. They were even more eager than Mr.
Hampton to browse, if that word can properly be
employed in this connection. But when they came to
examining the rolls, they found that it was only with
difficulty they could here and there decipher a word.</p>
<p>However, the similarity of languages was such
that in time the mother tongue could be learned and
the treasured knowledge of this most ancient of
libraries in the oldest living city on earth, could be
unlocked and given to the world. To the task of
learning the language and of putting the library in
order, Captain Amanassar who had been elected
President of the new republican government, assigned
Amonasis, Amrath and two dozen assistants,
comprising the best educated of the young revolutionists.
Eagerly, they began their task.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>At length, with a story that later was to astound
not only the scientific world but all civilization, Mr.
Hampton, finding his advice no longer was required,
decided to depart. They had been absent from home
five months. Bob and Frank were overdue for their
Senior year at Yale. Mr. Hampton was to be the
unofficial representative of the Athensian government
to the United States, and was to pave the way
for official representatives to be sent to the various
world capitals by making public his account of
events.</p>
<p>In addition, he was to interest capitalists in developing
the resources of the country, and in building
a railroad linking up Athensi with the Cape-to-Cairo
Railroad.</p>
<p>He promised to return the following year, estimating
it would require that length of time at least to
perform his various commissions. On his return,
the boys planned to accompany him and to build a
great radio station at Athensi, which would put the
mountain people in touch with all the world.</p>
<p>True to his promise, they did return the following
year, carrying to Athensi a great caravan of supplies
for the erection of a completely equipped radio
sending and receiving station. These supplies were
taken up the Niger by boat and finally across the
desert by camel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>But after finishing the erection of the station, the
three Radio Boys set out on an exploring expedition
through the heart of Africa in the interests of a
new motion picture producing corporation among
the backers of which were both Mr. Temple and Mr.
Hampton. And the adventures which befell them
upon this 5,000 mile journey through jungle wilds
and in coming into contact with savage men and
beasts, were numerous and varied.</p>
<p>All will be duly chronicled in &ldquo;The Radio Boys
in Darkest Africa.&rdquo; Until then, let us bid them
good-bye.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
